*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Todd: [――They've only recently turned into <u>zombies</u>. Some of them were alive just a few hours ago. Those who died in this battle are coming back to life one after another… But we can't say for sure yet.]

Subaru: [But I understand what you mean about them having just turned into <u>zombies</u>. It's like they don't know what their own weaknesses are. We aren’t the only ones who don’t know much about <u>zombies</u>…]

Todd: [They themselves are the same. However, if they have a head to speak, they probably have a head to think as well. The more time we give them, the more we can fill in those unknown parts, and the more their possible weaknesses disappear.]

Subaru: [That's why we need to strike before the enemy becomes fully prepared―― oh.]

Todd: [What? What did you notice?]

Subaru: [――――]

Todd: [Don't be coy, just say it.]

Subaru: [I'm not being coy. It's just that <u>zombies</u> don't really understand their own bodies. So if we inform them instead――.]

△▼△▼△▼△

He let Louis cling to his back and squeezed Beatrice tightly against his chest.

The same basic position as when they were riding on the back of the Galewind Horse; however, the situation they were placed in was quite extreme, and he did not have time to worry about the girls.

The surrounding scenery changed in an instant, and soon after, beside a house that was shattered by a furious blow, Subaru and his allies appeared in the air, taking the back of the hostile zombie.

Tanza, who threw houses, and Idra, who threw rubble, attacked in waves―― it was a pretty funny warfare strategy when you put it into words, but it was not only the words that were funny, but the picture as well.

This was not about why the child was throwing the larger ones and not the adult. In the first place, the tactic of throwing a house itself was ridiculous.

Nevertheless――,

Tanza: [Since I’m receiving Yorna-sama’s love, then I have to do at least this much.]

Since she reliably accepted it like this, the impact of the scene could be shelved for now.

In fact, the mysterious enhancement of the entire Pleiades Battalion applied to Idra as well, but it was not as good as Tanza, who had stacked Yorna’s as well. It was all about being the right person at the right place.

From that perspective, their opponent’s attention was drawn by the wave attacks using big and small tools―― once their focus was on Todd, Subaru and his allies made a surprise teleport attack.

Subaru: [――――]

The zombie twisted in mid-air; the enemy, with his distinctive one-eyed face, blackened the white part of the large eye in the center of his face, while his golden pupil glowed brightly.

A terribly cruel, blood-scented evil sneer was etched upon his mouth, sending shivers down Subaru's spine.

Was he always the type of person who would laugh hysterically in the midst of battle? Or perhaps he had changed since he became a zombie; they did not know which one it was.

However――,

Beatrice & Subaru: [El――]

Quickly, Subaru and Beatrice simultaneously held up their hands and pointed them at the enemy in front of them.

If their opponent showed a move to avoid Subaru and Beatrice’s attack with the utmost effort and no hesitation, then their strategy would fail.

In that case then perhaps, even with their best efforts, they would not be able to surpass this enemy.

But that would not happen. Because Subaru―― no, because Subaru and his team forced them into this situation.

Izmail: [――Hk.]

Sure enough, the zombie turned around with a startling gait and, catching Subaru and the others in its large single eye, took a posture of swinging his battleaxe in his grip instead of taking evasive action.

It was a strategy that involved taking Subaru and crew’s attack, then defeating them with a counter attack―― the traditional tactic of incurring damage so as to inflict greater damage on your foe, but the desperation put into the attack here was different.

The zombie's body regenerated wounds inflicted in little to no time.

That is why the enemy thought that they could take Subaru and his team's attack with no risk, and then use it to launch their own counterattack.

Unfortunately――,

Beatrice & Subaru: [Minya――!!]

――Unbeknownst to them, that was the path to defeat that Subaru and his allies had carved out..

With his battleaxe swung to counter attack, the enemy took a serious hit from the purple arrows released from the hands held up by Subaru and Beatrice.

Three brightly shimmering, amethyst crystal arrows pierced the left half of the Cyclop’s body.

Izmail: [Brilliant tactic, but――]

Without paying attention to the purple arrows that had pierced him, the enemy bared his teeth and howled at his prey, Subaru and his friends.

A zombie's body, oddly enough, broke in a brittle manner when it was shattered, much like pottery cracking, even though it retained some strength.

His broken body would then be repaired like a video played backwards, and the zombie would attack as if nothing had happened――,

Izmail: [Wh, at…?]

――But he could not do it.

The amethyst arrows that had pierced the zombie's body did not shatter its body from there, but rather remade the body into the same amethyst crystals as the arrow. The crystallized part of the zombie's body then cracked, and this time the zombie's body shattered, but the parts did not regenerate.

The particular effectiveness of Yin Magic against zombies―― that was the enemy's weakness that had been identified during their retreat up to this point.

――Although there was not an abundance of opportunities to check over a long period of time, several common characteristics were observed in the zombies.

For example, a zombie's fatal wound was closer to the heart than the head.

However, since piercing their chest would not kill them, fatal may not be the right word. Nevertheless, it was a fact that zombies, which regenerated wounds on their bodies with abnormal resilience, healed more slowly when the wounds were close to their heart.

Since blood did not flow when an arm or leg was lost, it seemed that the heart probably no longer served to pump blood to the body, but it had not lost its function as a vital part of the human body.

As those characteristics of zombies that could not be beaten were revealed, it was Beatrice's Yin Magic that was recognized to be effective at defeating zombies.

Beatrice explained that the Yin Magic “Minya” had the effect of freezing the time of the target, which was a kind of instant death magic, and it seemed to be especially effective against zombies, who relied on their regeneration.

According to Todd, if you burned a zombie's body down to ashes, you could stop the enemy from regenerating just as if you had hit them with Minya, but there was no use in asking for something you did not have.

Subaru: [This is the strongest use of the hand we have!]

Regardless of the strength of the enemy zombies, they could be defeated if they were hit with Beatrice's Minya.

In that case, the result of thinking about a strategy to hit it was to make the enemy, who continued to demonstrate its ability in life, understand the merit of becoming a zombie.

Beatrice: [They are not damaged by attacks. If one gets attacked and finds that they can heal quickly, anyone would contemplate relying on that power, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Before he turned into a <u>zombie</u>, I'm sure he would have easily avoided that.]

Louis: [Au!]

It was a declaration of victory for Subaru, Beatrice, and Louis―― or rather, both admiration and pity for their enemy.
 
This warrior who came back to life as a zombie was undoubtedly quite the skilled warrior in life. Even as a zombie, there was no discernible change in his fighting ability, but there was a distortion in the ideology with which he approached battle.
 
If only he had not been so arrogant as to think that receiving an attack would not be a problem.

Subaru: [There was no way he could have seriously taken that shot.]

Izmail: [――――]

The zombie's eye widened as it spun with the shock of the magic he was exposed to.
 
Subaru bit his lower lip as he felt a whirlwind of emotions, a mixture of astonishment in that eye and understanding that the realization of his own defeat came over him, cursing the unreasonable fate that had befallen this warrior.
 
Even if Subaru were cursed at for crystalizing the left half of his body and making him taste death for the second time――,


Tanza: [――Schwartz-sama!]

Immediately after a moment of sentimentality washed over his heart.
 
Subaru was called by Tanza in an urgent voice, and he suddenly realized the truth of the situation. Spinning in the air, turning away, and then turning back to face him, the look in the enemy zombie's eye had changed color.

It was not as if the color of the dead’s distinctive golden eye had changed.
 
But the astonishment and understanding that had been floating in it had faded, and it had been replaced by an intense hostility.

At one point, the enemy almost accepted his defeat along with the impact.
 
That had changed the complexion of his eye. ――Perhaps Subaru's last word was the catalyst.

Izmail: [Not yet.]

Subaru: [――He’s not dead!]

In front of Subaru, who gasped at the sight in front of him, the enemy, whose crystallization was advancing across the left side of his body, kicked something into the air.
 
It was a fragment of a shattered house-cannonball. Even though it was just a fragment, it was as big as a person's head. Kicking it into the air, the impact shattered the zombie's left arm from the shoulder and blew it away.
 
In return, the flying debris instead flew straight at Subaru's face――

Louis: [Uau!]

Just before he was hit, Subaru had a vision of his skull being shattered by the fragment.
 
It would have been a fatal blow, but it did not reach Subaru. Because a figure, Louis, intervened before it hit Subaru, and took his place.

Subaru: [Louis――!]

Clinging to his back, Louis forcefully pushed Subaru's body down, moving him out of the path of the debris and into the line of fire herself instead.
 
As a result, Louis caught the debris without protection, was torn from Subaru's body, and was blown away.

Beatrice: [Subaru, don't look away, in fact!]

Beatrice called out to the distracted Subaru as Louis was blown away. She kept her body in Subaru's arms and reached out her hand to attack the enemy.
 
However, the opponent was not so simple-minded as to be fatally struck twice.

Izmail: [――Hk.]

With fragments of his arm flying through the air, the enemy skillfully read Beatrice's pursuit with Minya and used what little remained of his left shoulder area to receive it.
 
He took on the damage in areas that were already crystallized, minimizing the progress of damage caused by the progression of the cracks.
 
It was truly the skill of an exceptional warrior――.

Louis: [Ua-]

As soon as he was awed by his skill, Subaru's collar was grabbed by an outstretched arm.
 
He had abandoned his battleaxe―― No, after losing the ability to wield the battleaxe, he displayed his obsession to not let Subaru escape.

Izmail: [Ooooh!!]

Subaru: [Gah!]

Subaru's body, which held Beatrice, was forcefully sent to the ground by the pull of the enemy's arm. Choking from the pain of his back hitting the hard surface, Subaru saw the form of the enemy up close and tried to quickly raise his hand.
 
But, however, the opponent's determined form met his gaze, and his movement stopped.

――The way he looked, full of ambition and the will to fight, it was hard to believe that it was from an already dead body.

Subaru: [――Hk.]

Beatrice: [Subaru!]

Tanza: [Schwartz-sama!]

Subaru's neck was constricted and desperate voices struck his eardrums as he gasped.
 
Hearing those impatient voices and the sound of the bones in his neck fatally creaking, Subaru's arms still did not rise. It was not that he was deprived of strength, but rather that his heart was no longer inspired.

Even though he knew that if he did not do it, he would be killed.

If they did not kill him, they would be killed, and he knew it.

Beatrice: [Minya!]

Subaru, unable to move, was supplanted by Beatrice, who had leaned in and fired her magic at the enemy.

By covering Subaru, it was the same as covering Beatrice in his arms. Naturally, the magic reached the target from a distance that ought to have been called point-blank range.

However, the enemy endured. ――The right arm that had tightened around Subaru's neck was defended to the death, and even if its torso was crystallized, the enemy at least tried to take him along with them.

Todd: [It’s because you are being strangely merciful.]

Immediately after such nonchalant words were spoken, the head of the enemy, which was trying to kill Subaru with its burning eyes, was severed at the neck.

Instead, emerging on the other side of the vanished enemy's head was a stone-cold-looking Todd.

Subaru: [――――]

Todd swung the axe in his hand and decapitated the zombie.

The head that was lopped off by Todd, it tried to turn its hatred toward him,

Tanza: [How dare you!]

And then Tanza's diving kick ruthlessly blew its head away. As it was, the Cyclops’ head continued to bounce down the street like a soccer ball.

Then the torso, which was left behind in its place, slowly crumbled, turning entirely into deep purple crystals.

Tanza: [Are you all right, Schwartz-sama!]

Subaru: [...Cough, cough, I, I'm fine. Sorry, thanks for the help.]

Shaking off shards of the enemy's collapsed torso, Subaru lifted his hand to Tanza, who was running toward him, assuring her that he was unharmed.

Tanza was relieved to hear Subaru's response, and then Subaru's face turned into an expression of surprise,

Subaru: [Louis! Where's Louis? Cover me…]

Idra: [It's no big deal, it seems like. It looks like she got hit by a piece of debris and has a concussion.]

The hasty Subaru received an answer from Idra, who was crouched a short distance away.

At his feet lay Louis, her upper body propped up, blood streaming from her forehead, her head swaying unsteadily.

Subaru: [Her head is not looking good…! Beatrice, please!]

Beatrice: [――. Of course, understood, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Please…!]

Subaru took in Louis's condition and rushed to his feet, pulling Beatrice's arm. For a moment, there was hesitation in her demeanor, but Subaru did not notice it.

Beatrice was the only one currently present who could use healing magic.

The other user, Rem, was asked to go with the non-combatants to bypass the area of battle toward the inner city in order to avoid an all-out battle against a strong enemy.

The more they were able to pull the strong enemies away from beside the ramparts, the more likely it was that they would be able to get out of the city safely, but this is where the impact of the possible lack of healers came into play.

Subaru: [Louis, you're going to be okay…!]

Subaru crouched down beside Louis with Beatrice and held her hand over the wound on her forehead; while Beatrice activated the healing magic, Subaru held Louis's hand.

Subaru's tight grip was returned weakly, and Subaru uttered a repeated “I'm sorry…”

All he could do was apologize. For it was completely Subaru's fault.

Todd: [So that girl can use healing magic too? You’ve sure got a lot of people with unusual powers around.]

Todd then called out to Subaru, who was watching over Louis's treatment.

He carried the axe that had decapitated the enemy's head on his shoulder, fixing his gaze on Subaru's slightly tense figure,

Todd: [And yet, if you keep going the way you are, their talent is going to go to waste. You're aware of that, aren't you?]

Subaru: [Todd…]

Todd: [Those who place confidence that they will not die in anything other than their own strengths are weak.]

Subaru: [――――]

Todd: [This not only applies to the Cyclops we just killed, but to you as well.]

The reason why he could not respond to those indifferent words was because he had unmistakably hit the mark.

That moment of weakness that passed through Subaru's mind as he saw his enemy shake off his looming defeat and grasped at victory. It was, as Todd said, the result of being overwhelmed by a thirst for life.

Subaru was not so naive as to dismiss it as a matter of course, though――.

Tanza: [Isn't it rude to speak like that?]

Todd: [――――]

Tanza: [Schwartz-sama is a contributor to the current battle. The way you talk about him, in that regard, is…]

Todd: [Don't snap at me. I give credit where credit is due. I acknowledge the achievements, I just think they aren't good enough. And the person who deserves the most credit is you or the girl who's down.]

When Todd stated that, Tanza's cheeks stiffened.

The girl who had played a major role against a strong opponent did not care about the praise directed at her, but was worried about Subaru, who had been hit with heartless words.

Her facial expression does not change much, but her inner compassion is rather strong.

Since Gladiator Island, she has developed a friendship with Subaru, and when Subaru was insulted, she was understandably angry on Subaru's behalf.

The absence of Todd's fiancée, Katya, from the event also adds to the intensity of the words.

Tanza: [Do you consider yourself to be right about everything? What if…]

Todd: [So don't snap at me. What I said is just a fact. That there are monsters out there who are so incredibly strong that they can be sure they won't die, and that there are others who think they won't die for no other reason than that. -- and neither you nor I am either of those things.]

Tanza: [That is]

Todd: [If the former is on our side, things go easily, but the latter, I don't want to be on our side. If they're enemies, you'll be able to take advantage of them like just now. Your guys' plan was spot on.]

Tanza: [―― Hk, you do not]

Speak for Schwartz-sama. And you just tried to snap at him.

With her face slightly flushed with anger, Tanza tries to snap at Todd. But Idra intervenes sooner than Subaru can stop her.

He holds Louis' body and calls out her name, "Tanza,”

Idra: [That's enough. That's not like you. It's always been your thing to keep your cool.]

Tanza: [... I'm just bad with emotional ups and downs. Besides, Idra-sama, you understand.]

Idra: [I know…]

Tanza: [I and Idra-sama are connected to Schwartz-sama, so I am sure that you can understand how Schwartz-sama feels in no small measure.]

Idra: [――――]

Idra frowned and kept his mouth shut at Tanza's complaint as his back remained turned. Seeing Idra's expression directly in front of him, Subaru gulped.

Although the Pleiades squadron benefited from Subaru's "Cor Leonis" effect, which gave them a greater degree of strength, the members with whom Subaru has a close relationship - Idra and the others, who are also from the same "Unit," and Tanza, who has a closer relationship with Subaru than the others - were able to sense the inadequacies of the group. 

There is a sense of relief for Tanza and others who do not see this as Subaru's fault or dishonor.

一On the other hand, he feels sorry that he still doesn't do enough.

That's what Subaru thought.

Louis: [Aa, u]

Suddenly, Louis grabbed Subaru's hand back and let out a weak sound.

As usual, the details of what that means, unspoken, are not known. However, it is clear that she is concerned about Subaru. Even though she is in a situation where she is more injured than he is.

Subaru: [If you can talk, you don't have to worry. When you've been patched up, I'll take you outside and let Rem take a look at you.]

Todd: [So, huh. Yeah, I guess so. I've just found a way. If you're goofing around, you can go to…]

He braced himself for the inevitable when he heard a strange sound -- a whirring sound that cut through the wind.

――He heard a strange sound, a humming, breaking wind.

Subaru: [――]

It sounded like the swinging of a rope with something light strapped to it, but the events that occurred immediately after the wind noise was heard were not so minor.

Tanza: [Gah]

A short moan spilled out, and Tanza's body trembled.

Then she looked down at her shivering body and opened her round eyes. -- something that looked like a tentacle with a sharp tip protruded through her back and abdomen.

Tanza's small body was pierced by a tentacle, which extended from the direction of the street that had collapsed in the aftermath of the battle, a long way from Subaru and the others.

The tentacles, extending like writhing serpents, had their starting point in the direction of――,

Tanza: [...Huh?]

The zombie's misshapen torso sprouted from its decapitated neck, and the tentacles extended outward from the end of it.

△▼△▼△▼△

Subaru: [――――]

At a momentary standstill, Subaru's thoughts were dyed white by the figure that trampled upon his imagination and understanding.

But in order to avoid that moment from becoming fatal, a voice spoke up.

Beatrice: [Subaru!]

Beside him, Beatrice's face had turned pale as she screamed, bringing Subaru's attention back to reality.

A sound like blood rushing to his head echoed in Subaru's mind, and he once again took in the scene before him―― a one-eyed zombie standing on the destroyed street, its transformed appearance caught in his gaze.

Their head had the same black eye with a golden pupil as before.

However, below the neck was not the sturdy body of a warrior, but a monster that could only be described as grotesque, with different thicknesses and lengths of paired left and right arms and legs.

The monster extended one of its fingers from its right arm, which was not a tentacle but a finger, and it pierced through Tanza's body.

Tanza: [――Ugh.]

The moment he saw it, the monster withdrew its long finger that had pierced through Tanza's body, and her body trembled again.

Her body, which had been pierced through the torso, spurted blood and she collapsed onto her knees with a powerless thud.

Subaru: [Tanza――!!]

Idra: [――Hk! This is bad! Schwartz!]

Immediately after Subaru shouted, Idra's palm, which had been thrust out from the side, forcefully pushed Subaru, as he reached out and began to run.

Subaru's body easily flew through the air from Idra's enhanced push. However, through his inverted vision, he quickly realized that Idra's push was the correct decision.

The position where Subaru had been until just before, the monster’s shriveled fingers struck.

The pavement and buildings along the way were sliced vertically with terrifying sharpness, destroying the city; if it was not for Idra's push, Subaru's body might have been sliced as well.

As it was, Subaru's body continued to fly through the air with great momentum――,

Todd: [Tch! Don’t tell me it regenerated from its decapitated head.]

Todd grabbed hold of Subaru with his arm, reaching up from below.

Stiffening at the sound of Todd’s voice coming from overhead, Subaru was shocked by the meaning of his words―― to regenerate from a severed head, “You must be kidding,” he muttered.

Subaru: [Even though we crushed and crystallized its torso, it's still moving! How is this possible!?]

Todd: [I don't want to admit it, but we have to face the reality that it exists. That eerie appearance of theirs…]

Beatrice: [That's because the formula for regenerating its body is buggy! I suppose.]

Todd and Subaru’s question, it was Beatrice who provided the answer.

She was wearing a look of frustration on her cute face, staring at the grotesque monster,

Beatrice: [It's the result of rejecting death by sustaining damage that should have killed it, I suppose!]

Todd: [――. In other words, they are even more filthy than other zombies… No, since they are already dead, it might be more appropriate to say that they are filthy in death.]

Subaru: [Ugh…! Beatrice! Idra! Hurry and save Tanza…!]

Idra: [I know! I know, but…]

In response to Subaru's desperate plea, Idra gritted his teeth and raised his voice.

He shared the same concern for the injured Tanza. However, if they acted recklessly, they would draw the attention of the monster. It was already evident that the monster's attacks could reach the Pleiades squad.

If even Idra fell, the chance of winning would vanish.

That was――,

Subaru: [I mean, in the first place…]

Louis had been injured by the fragments, and Tanza also suffered serious injuries that were clearly life-threatening.

The zombies that they thought they had beaten not only were not completely defeated, but they had also transformed into a grotesque creature and stood in their way. This situation seemed as if they had entered a dead-end loop.

Subaru: [――Don't be ridiculous.]

Subaru cut off the foolish thought that had briefly crossed his mind.

A dead end of fate, there were loops that could not be resolved no matter what one did. Todd, who carried Subaru, had even brought about such a situation before.

However, Subaru was there to stay. ――Moreover, Subaru had been saved.

Even if he had given up on himself, he could not give up on everyone else.

Todd: [――You have a creepy look.]

Subaru: [Eh?]

Todd: [That's the look of someone who treats their own life and the lives of others differently,] Todd replied.

Subaru switched gears with a loud sound in his mind. Todd muttered those words while looking closely at Subaru's expression, but Subaru couldn't understand what was going through Todd's mind.

In Todd's heart, there should have been no doubt of disgust as he murmured those words while watching Subaru's expression up close.

Todd: [Let’s go.]

After saying that briefly, Todd kicked the ground strongly while holding Subaru.

And then, unbelievably, he turned his back on Tanza, Beatrice, and everyone else and made a beeline for escape while still carrying Subaru.

Subaru: [What!? What are you doing?! If we separate from everyone…]

Todd: [You need to look closely. Its aim is the two of us, me and you.]

As he said that, Todd leaned his body and jumped into a side road.

In that moment, Todd's afterimage was grazed by a finger that seemed to pierce through the pavement, and the smell of burning air tickled Subaru's nostrils.

For a moment, something flashed before his eyes. 

It was that monstrous creature, its single eye glowing ominously, chasing after Subaru and the others.

Todd: [That thing's target seems to be me, who killed it once, and you, who killed it twice.] 

Subaru: [...hk! I figured I'd lure it away and keep everyone else safe?] 

Todd: [If others are involved, your reaction time slows down.]

Todd looked down at Subaru with his green eyes and said that.

Held by him, Subaru is shaken, and as he is stared at by those icy eyes, he feels a fear equal to or greater than the approaching grotesque figure.

Even in this situation, Todd's gaze towards Subaru was not just a mere appraisal, but something more.

Todd: [Can you think of a way to take it down without your partner?]

Subaru: [And if there isn't one?]

Todd: [That may be frustrating, but sometimes we have to leave things to chance.]

Subaru understands that it does not necessarily mean what it says literally.

Subaru realizes that Todd's statement does not necessarily mean that they will leave things to chance. Since they share the same conditions of being targeted, Todd would use Subaru as a decoy and make a run for it if the situation turns unfavorable for him.

He was not doing it right now because the plan of using Subaru as bait to escape had a low chance of success.

Conversely――,

Subaru: [――In other words, if there's a way, will you lend me a hand?]

Todd: [――――]

In response to Subaru's question, Todd's expression tightened again.

Subaru kept scanning his surroundings, while Todd skillfully used obstacles to avoid the monster's attacks and evade its line of sight. All the while, Subaru was being carried by Todd, looking for the building they were heading to in the Imperial Capital.

It was the building that Idra had mentioned as they escaped.

He had come up with a plan he thought of separately from the plan to hit Minya, but since he had no way to lure the enemy to the building, he had eliminated it as an option――.

Todd: [Can you do it?]

Subaru: [――I'll do it.]

Todd: [――――]

As soon as Subaru answered the question, Todd raised his eyebrows slightly in surprise, and then sneered with a cruel twist at the corners of his mouth.

And then――,

Todd: [All right. ――I'll follow your plan.]

 △▼△▼△▼△

――As he chased after his fleeing target, the "Giant Eye" Izmail's thoughts had shattered to pieces.

Izmail: [――――]

Due to his flickering vision, and scattered thoughts, his unsightly movements were far from refined.

With his limbs of uneven length scraping against the ground, he was unsteady like a newborn animal, and as he slammed into walls and against the ground, his hands, then his fingers, were outstretched towards the backs that were growing distant.

Izmail could not recall the reason for his obsession with those two fleeing enemies.

Having already almost forgotten even that it was once Izmail, the grotesque monster grew new limbs from the cracks it sustained each time it fell, furthering its ugliness.

――It was undoubtedly the runaway regeneration that Beatrice had pointed out.

However, after being resurrected by the will of another, those mutations occurring in Izmail's body, which had been unusually estranged from death, were something that not even a surgeon could keep in check.

What would happen to the monster after it slaughtered the two targets of its obsession?

Izmail: [OOoooo…]

Everything altogether was uninteresting to that monster eerily letting out hollow roars.

Izmail: [――――]

The larger of his two targets was carrying, the smaller one and fleeing, and as soon as it seemed like he could grab their backs, they would pull away, forcing him to continue repeating his unsuccessful strikes.

However, his opponents could not keep fleeing forever. By continuing to run awkwardly, limbs had grown all over his body after he fell, so Izmail would not fall anymore.

And since he would not fall, it stood to reason that the one with more limbs would run faster.

Therefore, little by little, little by little by little by little, Izmail shortened, and shortened and shortened and shortened, the distance to his targets that were trying to escape――.

Izmail: [AO―]

With a short roar, Izmail's fingers gouged his fleeing target's back and shoulders.

Blood spurted, and a wicked smile appeared on Izmail's face as he heard the screams of his enemies. It felt good. Brimming with joy, he wanted to hear more and more blood, and more and more screams.

Rarely, they would randomly make a turn, and he felt a sense of desperation that was unlike how they had been till then.

Chased by Izmail and reached by the monster, his targets frantically fled, unwilling to be torn to shreds. He aimed for their limbs, especially those of their upper bodies, and wounded them.

If he aimed for their legs, his targets would not be able to escape. If he did that, then this would end.

When it ended, he would be lonely. When it ended, he would be disappointed.

So, don't let it end, forever and ever――.

Izmail: [OOOoooo]

With a low roar that shook the air, Izmail smashed buildings and stomped through the streets, kicking at the waterlogged ground in pursuit of his targets.

The distance between them was suddenly shrinking, and having perhaps finally exhausted their stamina, his fleeing bleeding enemy clicked their tongue as they leapt into a nearby building.

With nowhere to run, they made the foolish choice to dive into a dead end.

Intuiting the end of this hunting time, Izmail――No, the monster that was no longer Izmail tore down the closed door and slipped inside.

His limbs had multiplied, and his body had ballooned, and with a frame incomparably larger than his original body, he could not easily open the door and enter the building.

Then, entering the dim building into which his targets had fled, the monster looked around inside.

The sources of light were meager, but even if he had grown this grotesque, his special eye alone remained unchanged, and with a blink, he switched the world he could see and searched for the figures of his hidden prey.

It searched, and then the monster realized.

Izmail: [――――]

――In the building they jumped into, there was so much flour fluttering around that it was enough to paint the monster’s whole body white.

The darkness was not the only reason for his hazy vision, but also because the inside of the building was filled with fluttering flour. Looking around, he saw that the building was lined with shelves, and each shelf was lined with bulging bags.

Those bags were torn open, and a great deal of flour had flown up in the building.

???: [It’s not going to be magic or special techniques that beat you.]

At the same time the flour-covered monster had noticed the state of the inside of the building, he heard that voice from behind. The monster turned around, and in his field of view, there was a small bright red figure.

That was one of the fleeing targets――No, before he knew it, there was only one fleeing target. Separated from the larger one, the smaller one that had been out of sight was there.

And then――,

???: [Take that, the quintessence of science―― A dust explosion!!]

Right after that shout, the small figure’s surroundings were also dyed red all at once――,

――A tremendous explosion blew away the mill shed, and the monster was engulfed by a crimson lotus.

Idra: [――Look, Schwartz, let’s mark that mill shed. It's the building with the waterwheel beside it.]

Idra, accompanied by non-combatants while riding a galloping horse and keeping vigilant of his surroundings, was the son of a miller before he was sent to Gladiator Island.

Subaru did not know exactly what the role of a miller was, but he had been told that they used the power of a waterwheel to mill wheat flour.

In other words――,

Subaru: [Using the materials in that shed, a dust explosion can be created.]

A dust explosion is a phenomenon in which flammable powdery materials are scattered in the air, and when a spark jumps into them, they catch fire in a chain reaction, igniting and exploding all at once.

In addition to the enclosed space of the mill shed, with a large amount of wheat fluttering about, and if a large spark dropped in――,

Subaru: [...I had no idea it would be so powerful.]

Leaning his back against the battered wall, Subaru muttered while coughing.

In front of Subaru's eyes was a mill that had been blown to pieces by the dust explosion that was triggered, and the ruins of the monster that had been engulfed in it were burned to ashes.

When he and Todd had to bait and defeat the monster, Subaru's plan was to make a dust explosion using the mill.

Of course, a dust explosion was not an easy thing to pull off, and he had no confidence that he would be able to successfully bait his skilled enemy in the first place.

So it wasn't just Subaru's strength that made the plan so successful.

Subaru: […You alive, Todd?]

Blown away by the impact of the explosion, Subaru stood up, blinking his eyes while shaking his head.

After a division of jobs, Todd took on the role of drawing the monster’s attention and running away until the mill was ready, while Subaru snuck into the shed and filled the building with dust.

Then, when Todd saw that the time was right, he jumped into the hut and threw a spark at the place where the monster was guided. The spark was also prepared by Todd.

Subaru: [Todd, Todd…!]

Todd: […You don't have to call out to me so pathetically, I'm still alive.]

Subaru: [――!]

Subaru, who had been calling out to the area around the epicenter of the explosion, evidenced by the many embers remaining, heard a slightly hoarse voice and turned to head in that direction.

Looking over, he saw where the wall of the shed had blown down onto the street and saw Todd on one knee. When he saw Subaru walking towards him, he spat out the spit in his mouth and said,

Todd: [You nearly got me killed, man.]

Subaru: […You’re making me look like the bad guy. I told you it would be very powerful, yeah?]

Todd: [Occasionally, an accident like that happens, but when I heard the principle, it made sense.]

As one would expect, Todd was breathing with difficulty as he fell back onto the street. Like that, he was looking toward the blown-up mill,

Todd: [What happened to the enemy?]

Subaru: [It was blown away. Completely…see]

With that, Subaru pointed to a part of the blown-up monster that was just visible from their position. Then, a part seared by the embers crumbled like sand and lost its shape.

Like the dispersal of the other zombies, it was the result of completely crushing its regenerative abilities.

Subaru: [How’re your injuries?]

This time, Subaru asked Todd after confirming that they had defeated the formidable zombie.

In dividing their jobs, Todd had no choice but to play the role of decoy since he could not be caught by the enemy and could keep running away for a while. However, he volunteered for the role himself.

This defied Subaru's expectations that he would absolutely avoid any plan that would endanger his own life.

Todd: [It’d be a story if I easily lost my life while trying to avoid injuries. We both just did our required roles. Although…]

Subaru: [Uh…]

Todd: [I was gouged out pretty much everywhere. I feel like I'm missing a lot of blood.]

As he said it, Todd raised one hand, and it was clear that his injury was quite severe.

Although he had no wounds that could be called deep, his shoulders and thighs were soaked with blood, and his face was pale due to the amount of blood he had lost.

If left unchecked, it would undoubtedly endanger his life.

Subaru: [I’ll immediately――]

Intending to call for Beatrice, Subaru tried to move.

Subaru and Todd's departure must have left Beatrice in a panic. But he was sure that she would prioritize Tanza's treatment.

Louis and Tanza's safety was also a concern, so they needed to hurry to meet up with Beatrice and the others. 

And then――,

Todd: [――After all, if we’ve done this much, Katya won't be able to complain.]

Subaru: [Huh?]

Todd: [We talked about this at the mansion, didn't we? Because she seems to think I'm lazy. I helped us escape, defeated a really strong enemy, and even suffered honorable injuries. Don't tell me you're also going to take all the credit for yourself, huh?]

Todd said that with a shrug of his shoulders and a pale face that was drained of blood. For a moment, Subaru was taken aback before letting out a "Hah" and exhaling a weak breath.

Despite being in such a battered state, the one that still weighed on his mind was Katya. Perhaps he had also planned to untie Subaru's mental tension, but either way.

Subaru: [Katya-san truly is important to you, huh.]

Todd: [That's a given. She's my fiancée. Katya is my very life.]

Todd declared this without any shame.

Upon hearing that response, Subaru took a deep breath, held it momentarily, and then by saying, "Alright," he fired himself up. 

Even now, he was afraid of Todd. The things that man had done had left deep scars on his heart.

Still, the fact remained that they had cooperated to defeat that monster here. Even to the extent of getting completely battered, Todd had devoted himself to ensuring everyone, including Subaru and his friends, could get out of this alive.  

If that was the case, then now it was Subaru's turn.

Subaru: [Wait here… No, someone who heard the explosion might come here. For now, just return with me along the way. Once we find a suitable place, wait for me there.]

Todd: [Ahh, I understand. I’m counting on you, so please don’t leave me behind.]

Subaru: [I wouldn’t do that!]

Todd made Subaru think that it may be possible to finish things without doing that.

However, even if Subaru had been in a hostile position towards Todd, he was unsure of whether he could have left him there on the verge of death. 

Subaru: [No, if I overthink it, I’ll get stuck in a rut. Anyway――]

Even if he were to lend a shoulder to Todd, their height difference would make it difficult. Subaru looked around the blown-off hut, hoping to find something he could use as a makeshift cane.

Then, he found a support pole for a shelf that had been blown into the midst of the embers――

Subaru: [――――]

――At that moment, a hard sound rang out.

Subaru: […Why.]

The moment the hard sound resounded, Subaru cast his eyes down and tightly clenched his fist. As his lips trembled, shoulders trembled in fear, and black eyes trembled, he muttered.

Subaru: [Why.]

Todd: [――――]

His question received no response; Subaru turned around as he exhaled.

Having turned around, before Subaru’s eyes were the blade of an axe that had been swung down, stopped just a hair's breadth away from crushing his skull.

――For it was restrained by that which was visible to none but Subaru, the Unseen Hand. 

Todd: [Tch, my bad, my bad.]

With a small click of his tongue, Todd released the axe from his hand and jumped backward. His swift movements showed no signs of blood loss or injury; Subaru grit his teeth.

Even that had been an act. The pain from his injuries, the plea for help from Subaru, speaking of his feelings for Katya, which had softened Subaru's heart, all of it was just an act.

Subaru: [WHY…?!]

Three times, Subaru had fired off the same question, glaring at Todd with a face that looked like it was about to cry.

While glaring at him, he felt tears welling up from the overwhelming frustration.

Subaru: [Up until now, you haven't done anything. You haven't killed anyone. I could have even forgiven you!!]

Todd: [Quietly, you've slowly damaged my trust in you.]

Listening to Subaru's screams, drawing a knife in place of the axe he had released, Todd readied himself.

That had been the declaration of the irreparable separation between Natsuki Subaru and Todd Fang.
