*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

???: [――Rem also came.]

Rem looked up quietly as a voice called out to her from her side.

At the coupling of the linked Dragon Carriage, a silver-haired girl named Emilia opened the door of the next car and called out to Rem, who was leaning her back against the wall of the car.

She has a beautiful face with a soft look on her face, and a girl holding her hand by her side. It was Beatrice who rushed with Subaru during the chaos in the Imperial Capital.

It is a touching sight, but Rem's feelings toward them are extremely complicated.

Of course, this was partly because these women were related to Rem's lost "memories" that she herself had no knowledge of, but that was not the only reason.

Unlike Ram, who she had instinctively known was her sister, and the other people who called themselves her companions, these two people are special. ――They are special in that they are deeply connected to Subaru.

Both of them felt a particularly strong connection to him during the situation surrounding the Imperial Capital, during the retreat, and afterward when they were visiting Subaru when he was unconscious.

Rem did not know why it bothered her so much――.

Rem: [Emilia-san and Beatrice-chan…]

Beatrice: [Rem is also concerned about where the discussion is going, I suppose.

Rem: [Concerned… yes, right, concerned I might be.]

When asked by Beatrice, who had addressed her by name, Rem looked down slightly.

The reason Rem is standing in the empty passageway is to watch over the room a short distance away ――the room assigned to Natsuki and Subaru as their sleeping quarters.

Subaru and Abel are now confronting each other in a quiet room after the large crowd of visitors had left.

Abel had a grim face, and when he was seen, he was often wearing an Oni mask, so it was refreshing for Rem to see his true face.

However, as far as Rem knew, Abel always had a scowl on his face when he was unmasked. Today, however, his already grim face looked even more than before.

Emilia: [Rem, you have been around Subaru and Abel… er, Emperor Vincent for a while, haven't you? How did they get along?]

Rem: [Emperor Vincent," I'm not used to calling him that. And I don't get the impression that the two of them got along. I would say that even though they had agreed on some ideas, they didn't get along…]

Emilia: [Ugh, so that's what I thought…]

Beatrice: [Well, that was predictable, in fact. Abel's way of thinking is like oil and water with Subaru, I suppose. Betty prefers the sentimental way Subaru thinks, in fact.]

Emilia: [Jeez, Beatrice is so quick to spoil Subaru. You have to properly listen to Abel's side of the story… um, Emperor Vincent's side of the story!]

Emilia's shoulders slumped at Rem's answer, but her lips pouted at Beatrice's subsequent assertion.

In front of Rem, whose expression seemed to change from one moment to the next, Emilia added a surprised "ah" and looked at her.

Emilia: ['Oh, and, Rem, since we're in Vollachia, you have to call me Emily…]

Rem: [...Um, what's the point of that?]

Emilia: [Eh, of course, there is. No one thinks I'm Emilia. Right, Beatrice?]

Beatrice: [Betty is kind because Emilia is too sweet to reply with any answer, I suppose.

Emilia: [Huh!? What does that mean!?]

Emilia's eyes widened at Beatrice's kind misdirection as she held her hand.

Rem felt that she was at the mercy of the two's hard-to-dislike interactions, but she soon grew fond of Emilia and Beatrice.

If what she had heard was true, they had risked a lot to come to this country to look for both Rem and Subaru. There was no way she could dislike them.

Rem: [Unlike him, I have no reservations.]

Subaru carried a stench that inspired fierce, instinctive alarm, and while a large part of Rem's hostility was due to it, there was no sign of it in Emilia and the others.
 
So, like with Louis, Shudraqian People, Flop, and others, there is no reason to bother snap at them.

Although――,

Rem: [...Suddenly, I'm also a bit afraid that his smell is fading.]

She was concerned about Subaru, who had lost his strong stench while they had been separated.

Since she did not know what exactly it was and since it is definitely better if it doesn't exist, so, she would say that things have improved.

She had thoughts in that manner.

???: [Huuh? It’s Rem-chan, Emily-chan, and Beatrice-chan!]

The door of the car on the opposite side from where Rem and the others were standing was opened, and the other party who appeared called out the names of the three in a loud voice.

Waving her hands vigorously, a tall woman strolled towards them――her long golden hair was freely arranged, her skin was exposed like a dancer's, and above all, she had fully grown arms and legs appropriate for her age.

She was――,

???: [――Medium-san]

Medium: [Yaho! Maybe everyone was worried about Abel-chin and Subaru-chin?]

Beatrice: [Yes, that’s right. Medium-chan was as well?]

Medium: [Yeah, yes! See, I finally have a big body again, right? Now, unlike when I was little, I can stop adults from fighting, so I thought I could be useful.]

With a cough, Medium puffed out her chest――they had not seen her for long, but like Subaru, she was one of those whose appearance had changed from an adult to a child.

The childish Medium was also very lovely, retaining her lively personality, but her charm remained the same regardless of the length of her arms and legs, so a familiar figure calmed Rem down.

It seemed that Medium was also very vexed when she was little, and she seemed to be enjoying returning to her large body as much as she could.

In any case――,

Rem: [To stop a fight…between that person and Abel-san?]

Medium: [That’s right~? It's been a while since the two of them talked properly, aren’t they going to go wild?]

Rem: [I don’t know…setting aside that person, I can’t imagine Abel-san going berserk.]

She had the impression that Abel was one who said painful things with a stern face and a harsh voice.

However, unlike Rem, who frowned at Medium's concerns, Emilia and Beatrice seemed to be more on Medium's side,

Beatrice: [Betty agrees with Medium, in fact. At least Subaru has a lot to say to that Emperor, so he should snap at him, I suppose.]

Medium: [That’s true. I'm a little worried about Emily too. A fight is not only about hitting each other, but also about hurting each other with words.]

Rem: [...is it like that?]

Certainly, it would not be a scuffle, since there was no impression that Abel would raise his hand, but it was quite possible that Subaru could become emotional, and the argument could intensify.

Because Abel was rational, Rem felt that Subaru had won people over frequently recently, but Abel may not have much leeway now. She hadn’t exchanged many words with Abel, who had regained his position as emperor, but she could understand the concern of Medium and Beatrice.

And that speculation was immediately verified to be correct.

Subaru: [――Okay? Let’s sneak over to Garfiel. If it's him, he should be able to understand our unavoidable circumstances.]

Vincent: [What a scandal of how a knight of the Kingdom raised his hand against the Emperor of the Empire.]

Subaru: [Don’t forget that if that goes to trial, I’ll talk about everything you’ve been up to as a last resort…!]

As they continued on like that, the door of the room opened as they argued back and forth quietly.

The eyes of Rem’s group, who were waiting for the discussion to be concluded, met the black eyes of the two men as they peeked out to see whether there was anyone in the aisle.

Subaru opened his mouth with an “ah” while Abel frowned with a “Mu”.

But that was not the extent of the reactions of Rem’s group when they saw the state of the two of them. After all, both Subaru and Abel, who both showed their faces, were covered in blood.

Rem: [Unbelievable…]

Medium: [You two were having a much bigger fight than I thought you would!?]

Emilia: [Oh, oh no! Beatrice! Quickly, heal him…!]

Beatrice: [It’s as you see, in fact! Betty should have been there, I suppose!!]

Subaru and Abel met their gazes at the group of women who welcomed them with a flurried commotion. Then Abel sighed, and Subaru raised his hands in resignation.

After that,

Subaru: [Um, you’re definitely going to get mad, but I need to tell you something before that…we made up.]

With a wry smile on his pitiable face, he said that as if he had a good little story to tell.

△▼△▼△▼△

——In the end, their injuries were just a few cuts, nothing impressive.

Medium: [But, the room’s a mess now and… we don’t have another room that we can prepare.]

Subaru: [No, I’m not going to tell you something as self-important as to prepare another room. I’ve seriously reflected on what I… Ah! Medium-san! You’re back to normal!]

Medium: [Hehe~, that’s right, Suabru-chin! Ah, no, that’s no good! I’m happy that you said that but I’m also angry at you. The two of you are hopeless~.]

Saying that, Medium put her hands on her waist and scolded Subaru for his poor attempt to change the topic of the conversation.

Subaru’s shoulders slumped in remorse, however, instead of the depressed Subaru, it was Abel, who Subaru had fought with, that received the brunt of Medium’s scolding. 

Medium: [Abel-chin as well, even though Subaru-chin is small that doesn’t mean that you can act immature, okay?]

Vincent: [You, do you understand what he did? He raised his hand against the Emperor.]

Medium: [Because you’re so great and all that and no one has ever scolded you, Abel-chin, you’ve grown up to be like this, haven’t you?]

Vincent: [————]

Abel frowned and crossed his arms, giving Medium a reproachful glare. The exchange that happened just a moment ago showed that, surprisingly, Medium had slapped Abel over the head.

Looking at the disastrous state of the room, it was reasonable to want to scold Abel for fighting with the young-looking Subaru, but Rem was impressed by the absurd act.

Rem: [If it’s okay with Medium-san, may I also hit him?]

Vincent: [Do not get ahead of yourself. We do not have the leisure to look over each instance of disrespect one-by-one at this time. To compare their achievements after the war, do not make it more difficult to decide whether or not to punish them.]

Rem: [I’m sorry.]

Of course, she had not expected to receive permission, but for Rem it was fruitful to hear the words “after the war” come from Abel’s mouth.

At least, Abel was looking towards the future. Although she did not know what had been said during their conversation, compared to when she had previously visited this room, it felt like the light and color within his eyes had improved.

Emilia: [——Okay, this is good. But, you need to change your clothes or else everyone will worry about you, you can go see everyone after you’re dressed properly, okay?]

Beatrice: [Truly, you’re so troublesome, in fact. You can’t allow Betty to have any peace of mind, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Sorry, sorry. But it’s been a while, it feels so fresh. For a while, when it came to people that worried about me, except for Tanza it’s all been men.]

Having wiped off the blood on Subaru’s face and hands with the hand towel she carried, Emilia patted him on the head.

Beatrice, with her hands, held out and seemingly trying to heal his wounds, shrugged her shoulders in relief, appearing to feel not only a sense of relief, but also a sense of joy.

Both of them seemed to feel happy to be looking after Subaru.

Looking at this, for some reason, Rem felt her chest tingle. 

Medium: [Hey, hey, Abel-chin, are you good to go?]

Not having noticed that which occurred in Rem’s heart, Medium tilted her head as she asked Abel this question.

Abel narrowed his black eyes at her question, and then nodded his head after a moment.

Vincent: [There is no obstacle. In fact, it is foolish to point at me and ask of the pros and cons of my struggles. Ever since I decided that I would assume the seat of Emperor, I lost the ability to act haphazardly.]

Medium: [——? Does that mean that you’re going to continue working hard as the Emperor?]

Vincent: [——. That is a foolish way of saying it, but roughly, yes.]

Medium: [I see! Then I also agree! Let’s work together~!]

Medium’s face suddenly brightened up and held her hand out towards Abel. Abel glared at Medium’s hand, and proceeded to turn his face away.

At Abel’s cold attitude, Medium withdrew her hand and clapped her hands together, producing a snapping sound.

Medium: [Well, where should we meet the others? Big bro also wanted to talk with Abel-chin.]

Vincent: [I do not have the time to talk with that thing, Serena Dracroy’s flying dragon boat should also be back soon. Either way, I need to talk with the main players now.]

Medium: [——Ah, please wait.]

Towards Medium’s urging, Abel drew his chin back.

For Abel, who liked to take care of things quickly, he knew that from now on, important discussions would have to be held to discuss how to deal with the problems occurring in the Imperial Capital.

Naturally, as people who were important to that discussion, it was already decided that Subaru and Emilia would be present, but before that, Rem had something important to say.

Half of the reason Rem stood here was because of her concern about the twisted relationship between Subaru and Abel, but the other half was because of that.

Subaru: [Abel, I also have something that I want to do before I meet everyone… something that I absolutely must do. So, let me go do that first.]

Rem: [Ah…]

Rem tried to stall the exchange, where she told him her reason for coming. However, Subaru interrupted Rem as he began to speak, turning his gaze toward her.

That gaze, that which he absolutely had to do, Rem understood that he was going to say the same thing as her. So, Rem pursed her lips, and nodded.

And then——,

Subaru: [——Rem, take me to Katya-san.]

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [What the fuck, brat? This ain't no place for you.]

When he visited his intended room, Subaru's eyes widened as he was greeted by a vulgar voice.

Standing behind the open door was a man with an eye patch and a face that matched the rough tone of the voice that greeted him ――for a moment, it was difficult to pull the memory out, but then it hit him.

Subaru: [Jamal… right?]

Jamal: [Oh? How do you know my name? I don't know you.]

Subaru: [You're alive…]

Jamal: [Aren't you a damned rude little brat, huh!]

The name of the man who opens his mouth with an unexpectedly clean set of teeth, his throat in a growl, is Jamal.

When Subaru was whisked away to the Vollachian Empire, he was one of the first Imperials he encountered ――and the man was Todd Fang's companion.

As far as Subaru knew, he was captured as a prisoner of war in the Fortress City of Guaral, when Todd helped a First-Class General who had been captured escape, by the people who remained.

After that, Subaru had been through a lot, and his safety had honestly slipped his mind.

Subaru: [Why are you, in this room?]

Jamal: [What's so weird about me being in my little sister's room?]

Subaru: [Little sister… ah.]

Hearing the question glaze over with its answer, Subaru remembered.

That said, Todd mentioned that his fiancée was Jamal's younger sister. In other words, Jamal in front of him and Katya were actually siblings.

The fickle Katya and the thuggish and wild Jamal are siblings.

Subaru: [Both your hair color and frizziness are similar…?]

Jamal: [I don't understand what you're saying, but I do understand that you're pissing me off. Brat, if you don't want to get hurt you should...]

???: [――Nii-san! Stop it!]

Perhaps annoyed by Subaru's attitude, Jamal rolled up his sleeves and made a gesture of trying to kick him out by force. But before he could do so, a shrill voice from behind him called him to stop.

Looking into the room past Jamal's side, the layout of the room is similar to the one in which Subaru was sleeping, and a woman is lying on a bed at the far end of the room.

It was――,

Subaru: [Katya-san.]

Katya: [You, you're finally awake, you, you've been sleeping too much. Seriously, really…]

Katya looked at Subaru across the body of her brother, who was standing in the way, as Katya sat up in her bunk. Then Jamal quickly walked over to her and said, "Oi oi,"

Jamal: [Take it easy! You don't know when you're going to die, so just relax and don't move.]

Katya: [I'm not that fragile! Don't compare me to a brother who doesn't even die when he's supposed to be dead…]

Jamal: [I didn't die in the first place, but you people would have killed me anyway…!]

Jamal, his concern unappreciated, and now stigmatized as a dead man, shuddered.

It is assumed that a lot happened in the reunion of these siblings, but it is not Subaru's real intention to delve into that. There was another reason for his visit.

???: [――. Are you all right?]

Subaru looked down slightly and saw that his feet were not moving very far from the entrance into the room, and it was Rem who was with him who asked that.

After apologizing to Emilia and the others and to Abel, Subaru visited this room with Rem.

As Katya's friend, Rem had every reason to be present here. ――because she should be able to hear what Subaru is trying to do from here on out.

Katya: [Yeah, I'm all right.]

Nodding, Subaru stepped into the room.

On the bed, Katya and Jamal were still arguing about something, but when Subaru arrived with Rem, Katya was the one who stopped talking.

As it was, she kept her blue eyes, framed by long lashes, downcast,

Katya: [...Is your body doing better now?]

Even if it is just a prelude to the main topic, her concern for Subaru's body was kind.

Her tone is blunt and brusque, but there is no doubt that she is a lovely woman at heart, and that is why she has become close to the unreliable Rem.

Subaru had to tell her.

Subaru: [Yeah, I'm all right. Thanks for worrying about me.]

Katya: [...I wasn't worried or anything. It's just that the girl seemed anxious.]

Subaru: [――――]

Subaru glanced toward Rem as she stood next to him, with a stiff expression.

Knowing roughly what was going to be discussed, he did not overreact to Katya's words as he normally would.

Subaru took a deep breath in and out, cautioning himself it is his own weakness of wanting to procrastinate on the main issue.

And then――,

Subaru: [I'm sorry I didn't bring Todd back.]

Yes, he informed her that he and Todd had had a decisive breakup in the Imperial Capital.

Katya: [――――]

Squeezing his small fist tightly, Subaru let the cruel fact be known with pain.

At the end of the battle in the Imperial Capital, Todd and him helped to break through the siege of zombies, but still, there was no choice but for them to clash.

Subaru decided not to kill Todd, a man who hated and abhorred Subaru's way of thinking and was determined to get rid of him, and they confronted and fought with each other.

But in the end――,

Subaru: [Um, he was swept away by the flash flood that swept into the city, and that's all.]

Katya: [――oh.]

Subaru: [But since we were fighting zombies, I had to use bait, and I had gotten a few injuries here and there. So…]

At Subaru's report, Katya's hoarse exhale escaped. As if to overlap with that sigh, Subaru describes what he saw to Katya in a way that is not exactly what he saw.

If he wanted to, Subaru could have given Katya hope.

The reality is that the last time Subaru saw Todd, he had been swallowed up by that muddy current and had disappeared. If his body had never been found, it might have shown some hope that he had survived.

But Subaru did not.

Subaru: [――――]

The last time Subaru saw Todd was when he was swallowed by that muddy water.

But, it is missing an exact description. To be precise, the last time Subaru saw Todd, he was in the form of a Werewolf, engulfed in the muddy water by a powerful axe blow deep into his chest.

――He was deeply wounded, unconscious, and swallowed by the muddy waters, but he was not saved.

Jamal: [――Hk.]

Upon hearing Subaru's story, the sound of Jamal gritting his teeth hard could be heard echoing through the room.

For Jamal, Todd was his companion, and, more than that, his future brother-in-law whom he had decided to entrust his sister Katya to.

It is a terribly odd feeling, but Subaru also wanted to hope that Todd survived if possible.

Though, his expectations were seriously betrayed, despite the fact that his life was threatened, and in a world where he had "Return by Death", he had lost his life more than once, he was still someone who had been betrayed by the very person he was trying to protect.

However, since he had a history of dealing with Todd on many occasions, he understood.

Todd was nothing but an ordinary person with no special powers. The fact that he was a Werewolf was not an advantage that could turn that deadly life-threatening situation to his advantage.

In a situation where Subaru was helpless and died, Todd would also lose his life.

Todd Fang died in that flood.

That was the answer of the closest person to him, Subaru, who witnessed his final burst of life.

Subaru: [――――]

Silence fell upon the room.

That silence seemed to slowly burn his forehead and the nape of his neck, a pain in his heart that Subaru decided to carry with him and had to take in stride.

So after a while, he continued to enjoy the sensation of his skin being burned.

Katya: [...You, you didn't see the crucial part of it, did you? So, then maybe, he's not dead.]

The voice was faltering and cracking, causing Subaru to look up.

Subaru, Rem, and Jamal all looked at Katya in bed, her blue eyes quivering as she fiddled with her hair,

Katya: [What, what if, you know? If you'd seen Todd's head get smashed in, or his body cut in half, or burned to a crisp, or something like that, you know? If you'd seen it, you might think, yes, but…]

Rem: Katya-san…]

Katya: [But see, he's amazing. He's, really dirty and alive. And besides, when we parted ways, he told me he would be back.  He would never lie to me about my brother's death! He just misspoke!]

Rem: [Katya-san!]

Raising her voice, Katya started clawing at her hair; the sight of which drew Rem to her, and she leaned over the bunk to hold Katya's head.

Cradling Katya's head in her chest, Rem caressed her back.

Rem: [Slowly, breathe slowly. I am right here beside you…]

Subaru: [No, no, she isn’t…that easy, right? Right, right, Rem…?]

Rem: [Katya-san…]

Large tears streamed from Katya's eyes, soaking Rem's clothes as she hugged her, and Rem continued to stroke her sobbing friend's back.

Subaru was strongly moved by Katya's honest reaction.

He understood.

That Katya would be hurt this way by telling her about Todd. It is a really, really difficult relationship, but Todd's feelings for Katya must have been genuine, and Katya was really cared for by Todd. That is why there are these tears.

That is why Subaru did not mention the crueler facts.

It was something that Rem was not even aware of. ――It was Rem who finished off Todd, who had turned into a Werewolf, with an axe.

In order to protect Subaru, Rem finished off Todd with a swing.

Since Todd was in his Werewolf form at the time, and since he did not undo his beastification until the last moment when he was submerged, Rem was unaware of this fact, and Subaru had no intention of letting her know either.

Subaru did not believe that the truth had any value here.

Todd loved Katya, and Katya loved him back. That is what matters. There is no reason to destroy those memories and dwell on what really happened.

Subaru: [Todd really cared about Katya-san. All the way until the very end.]

That was the honest motive that only Natsuki Subaru, who had been the target of Todd Fang's naked murderous intent, could convey to Katya Aurélie.

Katya: [――Hk.]

Katya, sobbing, wrapped her arms around Rem's back as she hugged her, and one could see her nails digging hard into Rem's back. It was painful, but Rem took it with silence.

In this room filled with sobs, Rem glanced at Subaru and shook her head.

Rem's intention was to leave Katya to herself, and that she was grateful to Subaru, who had come prepared for this to happen.

Jamal: [――. Sorry to make you have to play a nasty role, brat.]

Jamal said this to Subaru as they left the room, leaving Rem and Katya behind.

When Subaru raised an eyebrow at Jamal's surprisingly straightforward words, he grimly wrinkled his nose with a, "What?]

Jamal: [It's a tough role to inform the family of a dead person. No matter how heroically and bravely the person died, there are still those who want to cry.]

Subaru: [ ...how about you?]

Jamal: [Ah?]

Subaru: ['Cause to you, Todd is your companion, your sister's fiancée, and he's special, right?]

With cheeks contorted, Jamal pondered Subaru's question.

After a moment of silence, he touched the eye patch that was covering his right eye with his finger,

Jamal: [I don't know. If the bastard had survived, I would have laughed it off that we both failed to die. However, I skipped that step. Well, if he died fighting, then he did his job as an Imperial soldier. Which is what he used to mock.]

Subaru: [――――]

As he said it, Jamal gave a small snort and laughed at the last part.

Subaru could not tell whether it was a laugh at the thought of Todd's uncharacteristic end, or whether it was a laugh based on some kind of imperial way that Subaru did not understand.

Whichever the case may be, Subaru did not feel that he could laugh at someone's death.

Jamal: [It's just.]

In front of Subaru, Jamal suddenly continued.

The tone of his voice caught Subaru by surprise, for what was in Jamal's continued voice was not anger or loneliness, but something like anticipation.

And that impression was correct, as Jamal says.

Jamal: [I don't think that son of a bitch will die easily, and what Katya says is true… Because I haven't seen him actually die.]

Subaru: [That is… Yeow.]

Jamal: [Quite, brat. That's the only hope Katya got, regardless of me.]

Jamal's finger flicked Subaru's forehead as he was about to argue with him. Having silenced Subaru, Jamal jerked his chin toward the door behind him to indicate to Subaru.

Subaru could not discern whether the hope Jamal spoke of was a bright one or a cruel one. However, he knew that he was not qualified to meddle.

Only those who were invited and allowed to participate in Katya and Todd's lives had the right to interfere with their feelings. ――Subaru was not entitled to do so.

Jamal: [Damn, for a guy who hated to fight, you got quite the hot-blooded attitude. And because of that, you crossed a much more dangerous bridge than I did.]

Looking up at the ceiling of the hallway, Jamal remarked about Todd.

Jamal did not show his face, his voice was shaky, yet Subaru was still not qualified to point this out.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Heello~, Subaru-kun, you’re looking well, areen’t~ you? You’ve been looking more youthful, I woonder~ if it’s thanks to the food of the Empire.]

Subaru: [Amazing. The only person that could make such a gaudy joke after seeing me, is Roswaal.]

Roswaal: [Oya, everyone else wasn’t calm enough to do that, riiight~?]

With his blue eye closed, leaving his yellow eye winking towards him, an expression that Subaru hadn’t seen in a while—— Subaru broke into a smile as he came face-to-face with Roswaal.

As expected, Roswaal was unphased as he looked at the shrunken-down Subaru, but Subaru decided not to mention his style which differed from his usual clown costume. It was a little vexing, it reminded him of when he changed his tone of voice, and intentionally omitted explaining anything.

After Subaru informed Katya of Todd’s final moments, Subaru went to the middle of the linked Dragon Carriages, to a larger passenger car that had been prepared for him. 

The linked Dragon Carriages—— According to Subaru’s knowledge, they were similar in structure to electric and railway trains, the likes of which could only be found in the Vollachian Empire which was flatter than most other countries.

Of course, because the amount of dragon carriages the Kingdom of Lugunica had rivaled the Vollachian Empire, if the right terrain was prepared, then it should be possible to prepare something similar; this was something that he would keep in the back of his mind.

Roswaal: [This linked Dragon Carriage, I dare say that it appears to be one of the secrets of the Empire. From what I’ve heard, it was invented by a member of the Nine Divine Generals known for their wisdom…]

Subaru: [I knew it. I’ve never seen something like this in the Kingdom… Thinking about it, we’ve seriously seen a lot of the depths of the Empire.]

Roswaal” [Hahaha, it would be disastrous if we’re prevented from returning because we peeked at the dark side of the Empire too much. From now on, I think it may be wise if we spend some time with our eyes closed.]

Subaru: [That’s, no laughing matter either…]

As Subaru grumbled, Roswaal laughed in agreement, and towards their talk, Otto wore a dismayed expression.

The passenger carriage in question was a dining car with a lot of tables, designed with enough space to fit roughly twenty people. However, the purpose of all of these tables was not for having a meal, but rather for discussions such as assemblies and war councils.

In fact, Subaru and Roswaal weren’t the only ones there, there were many others as well.

Of course, there was Emilia and Beatrice, who had come here earlier, who were sitting at the same table as Ram.

Ram gave Subaru, who had come alone, a scornful gaze.

Ram: [Little Barusu, what’s wrong with Rem? You should be together with her.]

Subaru: [You definitely didn’t need to use that name… Right now, Rem is with Katya-san. For this discussion, I don’t think we’ll be seeing her face.]

Ram: [——. Okay.]

Spilling out a sigh, Ram did not go any further into Subaru’s answer.

Finally, Ram had managed to meet her younger sister Rem, but apparently, they were not as clingy with each other as Subaru had thought they would be. Originally, he had the impression that the two of them were quite close with one another, so Subaru had hoped that the two sisters would be constantly holding each other’s hands.

Ram: [Ram and Rem are both individual people. Don’t force your own convenient feelings onto us, little Barusu. It's disgusting.]

Subaru: [Don’t read other people’s minds! It isn’t disgusting!]

Ram: [While Ram couldn’t be around, it was the people around Rem that supported her. Don’t think of belittling those relationships. Shameless, undeveloped Barusu.]

Subaru: [Let’s see how long it takes for you to use up all of your variations of my nickname, Nee-sama…!]

As his cheeks twitched at the various words and acts of Ram, Subaru took a deep breath.

Ram had a point, it wouldn’t be good to rush. First of all, the sisters had been successfully reunited, so they should not rush and slowly advance forwards.

There was no need to worry, there was a bond between Ram and Rem that no one could get between.

He was able to believe this from the atmosphere he had felt when they had come together to visit Subaru.

Subaru: [But, is this all of our members? Petra and Frederica, Garfiel?]

Emilia: [Petra and Frederica are taking care of the soldiers that are fighting. Garfiel as well, he’s also busy with the wounded.]

Subaru: [The fighting, that’s still ongoing?]

Emilia: [Yes, it is. Subaru, too, I think I saw you do a lot of it, but…]

In regards to the whereabouts of the missing members, Emilia slightly hesitated with her answer.

What she was about to say, Subaru could guess what it would be about.

Subaru: [Zombies…]

Otto: [W-what is that, that strange name.]

Subaru: [A dead person that can move around. In my hometown, we call them zombies. I thought it would be better if they had a name, so I called them that for the sake of convenience.]

Otto: [Natsuki-san’s hometown, they have a lot of weird things?]

Otto turned reproachfully towards Subaru, whose mouth curved into a smile.

In this case, he thought about whether he should argue that this world in which zombies had actually appeared was stranger, or whether his world in which zombies were the subject of so many works of fiction was stranger, though he did not understand the fascination with the subject.

Roswaal: [I see, that’s good, zombies. At least, we can avoid calling them corpse soldiers.]

Then, Roswaal cut in between Subaru and Otto’s conversation.

Subaru ruminated on the words “corpse soldiers” that came from his mouth.

Subaru: [Something like that, seems like it comes from bad memories, right?]

Roswaal: [That is indeed the case. It’s a memory that I don’t wish to remember.]

Roswaal: [As I told you in the Imperial Capital, I believe that it’s safe to say that this is the result of the Sacrament of the Immortal King. The last time it was recorded to have been used was during the Kingdom’s civil war.]

Subaru: [And so you have a bad memory.]

At Subaru’s gaze, Roswaal gave a vague smile as he declined to say anything.

Roswaal had a deep knowledge of the past. Even if he himself hadn’t participated in the civil war, he may have had a bad experience with the Sacrament of the Immortal King.

Beatrice: [But, as far as Betty knows, that secret art is meant to be an unstable product, I suppose. To create such a great number of zombies and reproduce them so well, it should be impossible, in fact.]

Roswaal: [But, they were truly moving and talking, so there must be some reason for it, no?]

Beatrice: [...Betty is also scratching her head, I suppose. Dudley, don’t slack off, in fact.] 

Roswaal: [Oya oya, I’m upset that you think that I’m slacking off. Since I’m also involved, there’s no reason for me to cut any corners. All of your lives also hang in the balance.]

Beatrice: [Betty doesn’t know how much to trust you, I suppose.]

Roswaal: [I understand. Because your life is also at stake.]

Beatrice: [What do you understand, in fact! Just more of your mischievous tricks, I suppose!]

Roswaal gave this answer with his chin resting on his folded hands, Beatrice’s face becoming red as she shouted at him.

Beatrice exploded with frustration at the teasing Roswaal, but even Subaru was not sure what Roswaal was thinking. However, since Beatrice was Subaru’s partner, he pulled down his eyelid and stuck his tongue out at him.

Beatrice: [Well, not really sure of the details, but let's just call them "Zombies," as Subaru said., I suppose?]

Otto: [It’s fine, isn’t it? It’s shorter than saying corpse soldiers.]

???: [I agree with Otto’s point of view…]

And so, like that the conversation of Subaru and the others came to a close,

???: [——Your Excellency, I have just received a report from Second General Kafma, they’ll remain in the Gairahal Tropics to keep an eye on the stragglers as much as possible.]

???: [Also from First General Olbart, he is using delaying tactics with the shinobis under his command! However, the less they need to call for food and water rations, the less that they’re able to do!]

Vincent: [Kafma Irulux and Olbart Dunkelkenn, tell them to continue their operations as they have been doing. Serena Dracroy, what of your Flying Dragon ship?]

Serena: [They have not yet returned. Hopefully the fact that it is taking longer than anticipated does not mean that the Fortress City has fallen.]

???: [...If it does what it was built to do, the Fortress City should not be unprepared.]

And so, with the flurry of several footsteps and important talk flying around, Abel and his three Imperial followers—— an old man, a large man, and a beautiful woman arrived in the carriage.

Subaru did not know any of their names.

Otto: [The old man is the Prime Minister Bertetz Fondalfon, the tall man is First General Goz Ralfon, and that woman is High Countess Serena Dracroy.]

Subaru: [You saved me… Goz, I think he’s the guy that was arrested for letting Abel escape.]

Otto saw the reason for Subaru’s frowning profile and noted his guesses of the identity of the individuals that had entered.

If he had survived, he would have been judged as an ally of Abel, so he was happy to see him at Abel’s side.

Vincent: [You are all here? Good, we can begin the war council.]

Subaru: [Hey, are Flop-san and the others okay?]

Vincent: [If there is a shortage of manpower at the Fortified City, what value would the addition of a peddler provide to this war council?]

Otto: [That’s right. Then why am I here…]

Beside Subaru who had tilted his head, Otto also tilted his head at Abel’s manner of speaking.

But, the reason that Otto had his tilted head was not known by the Emila Camp, Subaru included. It was natural for Otto to be present here.

Ram laughed scornfully with a “Ha.”

Subaru: [Taritta-san and Mizelda-san and the others are set up at the back of the passenger car, they won’t be here for this discussion, right?]

Vincent: [Yes. We have heard from the People of Shudraq. They have assured me that when the time comes for them to utilize their power, they will do so with full force.]

Goz: [Certainly, I never thought that I would get the chance to stand side-by-side with the People of Shudraq known for their bravery and courage. If it weren’t a struggle for the life or death of the Empire, I’d be even more excited! Ah!]

Vincent: [You make too much noise. Keep your mouth closed.]

Abel silenced Goz, causing him to clinch his fists which were the size of a child’s head as he restrained himself. It was an inconsiderate remark but nobody paid it any attention, so it was probably just a typical exchange between them.

At any rate, he now understood why Flop and the "People of Shudraq" were not present.

Vincent: [Subaru, your friends of the Empire are…]

Subaru: [I have already told everyone in the Battalion that I would speak as their representative. Uhm, there’s something I want to discuss with everyone. Especially with Beako.]

Beatrice: [With Betty? …Betty doesn't have a very good feeling about this, in fact.]

Subaru: [There, there, there.]

For now, he had asked his Pleiades Battalion comrades to refrain from being present here.

After all, Subaru and Abel were in the same room. With one wrong move, Weitz could have attacked Abel and tried to hand over the throne to Subaru.

The lie that Subaru was the illegitimate son of Abel ――Vincent Vollachia, that he was the black-haired Crown Prince, continued.

Subaru: [I thought at least Tanza could be here…]

Subaru was the only one who attended the meeting as a member of the Battalion, as he did not feel comfortable taking her out of her room as she did not look well.

As was the case when she visited him, he would definitely have to talk to Tanza later.

Subaru: [Also, I haven't seen Louis around…]

Ram: [That girl is with Medium and Flop. You seem to have a lot of feelings for her, but what do you intend to do with her, Barusu?]

Subaru: [――. We can talk about that later too.]

Ram's light-crimson eyes narrowed, and Subaru had no choice but to reply.

Ram knew that Louis was there at the Pleiades Watchtower right before Subaru and Rem were sent to the Empire. Naturally, from Ram's mouth and from Abel's, Louis' true identity was shared with everyone.

Still, she would like to know with whom and what kind of work and effort had made it possible for her to be on board this Coupled Dragon Carriage.

In addition, they had to find the best place to drop Louis off.

Vincent: [Now that you’ve finally caught up, we’ll start the war council, Natsuki Subaru.]

Subaru: [You, don't forget that I'm holding onto an enormous scandal, okay? Well, that’s true, but that’s not it.]

Abel's attitude on the surface had not changed, even though he vividly remembered him gently bowing his head. Subaru tried to stop his manner of using abusive language.

There was still a companion whose movements had not yet been confirmed.

That was――,

Subaru: [――What about Priscilla? She must have been in Guaral, and wasn't she also at the Imperial Capital City? Also, according to Tanza, Yorna-san was also there.]

Subaru asked while looking at Abel's face.

Somehow, Priscilla and her amusing companions came to the Vollachian Empire. Al even accompanied him to the Demon City of Chaosflame, so he was sure they were involved in the battle for the Imperial Capital of Lupugana.

As for Yorna, Subaru and his group had also received information that she had joined the rebels. Tanza also felt Yorna's presence at the Imperial Capital.

Naturally, such faces must also be on board the Coupled Dragon Carriage.

Speaking of a face he hadn’t seen, he hadn’t seen Cecilus either, but Cecilus' moodiness was the same as it was before he left Gladiator Island, so he was not worried about him――,

Subaru: [――Hey?]

However, when Subaru asked him about them, Abel fell silent and closed one eye.

Suspicious of his reaction, Subaru furrowed his brows as he looked around to see that Abel was not the only one who had such a reaction.

For some reason, nobody would say anything about Priscilla's group’s movements.

If Priscilla and the rest of her group had heartlessly returned to the Kingdom before the Battle of the Imperial Capital, then Emilia and the others would have been surprised when hearing Priscilla’s name.

That wasn’t the case. And the answer to this uncomfortable silence was――,

Beatrice: [――Subaru, that was kept secret to avoid chaos, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Beako?]

Beatrice took action before he knew it and squeezed Subaru's hand. Subaru's cheeks tightened at Beatrice's preamble.

Then, Emilia turned her attention towards Subaru, who unconsciously held Beatrice's hand tightly,

Emilia: [Listen to me calmly, Subaru. About Priscilla and Yorna-san…]

She paused for a beat.

Emilia continued to answer while it felt drawn out to the anxious Subaru.

That was――,

Emilia: [When we were all fleeing together from the Imperial Capital, we didn't find those two. ――But I want to believe that they’re safe.]

――It was a definite proof of the wounds inflicted on their side during the Battle of the Imperial Capital.
