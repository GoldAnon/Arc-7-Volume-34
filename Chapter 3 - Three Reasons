*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Jumping out from the entrance of the detached building, Subaru stood in front of a thinly smiling man.

It was perhaps the most foolish choice he could have made in the face of that man, or his rigidity was. However, even for Natsuki Subaru, who had experienced all kinds of hardships and even Death many times, the inexplicable eeriness of this man made his mind go blank.

A sense of fear that not even a Sin Archbishop could recreate, and a feeling of being ensnared by it.

Subaru was made to feel that way by Todd Fang.

???: [――――]

Confusion has arisen around Subaru, who stopped reflexively in response to the voice he had heard.

Beatrice, who was holding hands with him, was facing the same opponent as Subaru. Other than her, Tanza and Idra were also looking toward Subaru, who was standing still, with suspicion.

Although his mind raced that he should immediately warn them to be cautious――,

Rem: [――Katya-san!]

Before Subaru could move his trembling lips, Rem shouted in a high-pitched voice.

When he looked, Rem's pale blue eyes, which had turned back towards Todd by the door―― No, they were directed not at him, but at the space just behind him.

Subaru struggled to take his gaze off of Todd and shifted his attention in that direction, but once he did, he understood the target of Rem's shout.

There was a wheelchair-bound woman hiding behind Todd's back.

The woman who was peeking at them by grabbing the hem of Todd's clothes matched the features that Rem had mentioned, with suspicious eyes that overlooked the world beneath curly brown hair

In itself, that fact was joyful―― No, the fact that she was beside Todd.

Rem: [Please, stay away from her…!]

Louis: [Uu!]

Rem, who seemed to have come to the same conclusion as Subaru, raised her voice and glared at Todd. Louis, who was always close to her, also growled while looking at Todd, apparently inspired by Rem's fighting spirit.

Despite losing his trademark bandana and letting down his orange hair, Todd's cruelty and dangerous mindset would not be diminished.

Even in this situation, the woman―― Katya, it was not difficult to imagine that he would try to use her as a shield to manipulate Subaru and the others into doing his bidding.

Of course, it was clear from Subaru's previous battle experience with Todd that the outcome of giving in and being controlled would ultimately result in Death.

Subaru: […From here on out.]

Subaru: [If I was to die, we haven't confirmed how far back I'll rewind.]

Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how one looked at it, during the entire series of events involving the siege of the Imperial Capital, the breaking of the city walls, and the invasion into the city, Subaru had never once lost his life.
。
Thanks to or perhaps because of that,  Subaru did not know the starting point of Return by Death.

Subaru was able to meet with Louis and Beatrice, and was also able to reunite with Rem and Flop.

To be honest, the situation was going well, almost too well. It was impossible to calculate how many retries it would take to reach this point.

However――,

Subaru: [――I’ll do it if I have to.]

If Subaru had decided whom to save, whom to let survive, and whom to move forward with, he was determined to firmly grasp that outcome.

That was why he was able to rescue all the Gladiators involved in the “Gladiator Island” incident and fight alongside the members of the Pleiades Watchtower until today. ――He had never given up, no matter what.

Even if the obstacles to overcome were the embodiment of fear that froze his heart, Subaru was determined to do so in order to achieve his goal of saving everyone and moving forward.

Thus, Subaru wet his dry lips with his tongue and acted decisively――,

Katya: [Wait! That's not it! I wasn't caught, Rem!]

Rem: [Katya-san?]

Katya: [Misunderstanding… Yes, it's a misunderstanding! Todd is, he’s not your enemy!]

Katya tried to move forward, turning the wheels of her wheelchair while loudly insisting that it was a misunderstanding and that Todd was not their enemy. However, Todd put a hand on her thin shoulder, stopping her progress.

Katya, with tears in her eyes, glared at Todd as she stumbled forward.

Katya: [Wait, what are you doing?! That's dangerous!]

Todd: [You're the one in danger. Don't move forward on your own.]

Katya: [W-who do you think I'm saying this for…!]

Todd: [Of course, it’s for me. But that doesn't mean I can overlook the woman I love doing something dangerous.]

Katya: [Ugh…]

Red-faced and having snapped at him forcefully, Katya was silenced by those words.

That was not because of embarrassment or shame, but mainly because his objection had conveyed that he was concerned for her.

It was a perfectly honest statement in which he sensed no deception, and for Subaru, he could hardly believe it.

Rem: [Katya-san, could it be, that person is…]

With a small gasp, Rem asked Katya this in a fearful tone. Although she did not clearly state the question, the intended focus of the question was clear.

Rem's hand on Louis's shoulder was weak, perhaps a sign of her hesitation and anxiety. Katya nodded her head while biting her lip in response to Rem's question.

Katya: [I told you, more than once. …He, you know, is my.]

Rem: [Your fiancé.]

Katya: [That's it…]

After being given a hesitant declaration, Katya responded clearly to Rem's question as such.

Rem's eyes wavered when she was told this, and she clearly was upset. Subaru was just as shocked as Rem, and was also very upset.

Subaru: [Fiancée…]

While not having the fondest memories of Todd, from their first encounter to the events that followed, the story of his fiancée was impressive apart from his insanely cautious and unforgiving nature.

Todd, who had been deployed as an Imperial Soldier and was encamped near the forest where the Shudraqian village was, frequently spoke of his desire to return to his fiancée.

But after a series of bloody encounters with Todd, his expectations for his humanity had faded, and it became a distant memory that lingered in a corner of his mind――.

Subaru: [They really did exist…]

And the words were so incongruous with Todd and his lovely fiancée that he had to let it slip.

Rem looked at Todd with suspicion in her stern eyes, and though she might not have heard Subaru's monologue,

Rem: [Are you really Katya-san's fiancé?]

Todd: [Yeah, it's true. Like I said before, it's an unconventional arrangement. I never thought that Katya and you would be getting along so well, housed in the Prime Minister's mansion.]

Rem: [――――]

Todd: [Don't look at me like that. Of course, I'm not saying we had a good first meeting or a good relationship either, but this is the situation we're in. We both have to let go of our grudges, don't we?]

Shrugging his shoulders at Rem's silent gaze, Todd spoke bluntly. Then his gaze turned not to Rem, but to Subaru.

Holding his breath, Subaru met Todd's gaze. Cold sweat ran down his back.

However――,

Todd: [What the kid said is true, right?]

Subaru: [――Ah.]

There was no hint of hostility in Todd's demeanor as he closed one eye and winked at him.

Exactly as he had said, he had let go of his hostility and caution and was extending a hand, as if it was the obligation of the person to propose cooperating with the other to get out of this situation.

Flop: [Husband-kun, Wife-san, who is Soldier-kun?]

At the sight of both Subaru and Rem going silent, Flop's soft face took on a serious look.

In response to his question, Subaru could not speak carelessly, partly due to his current appearance. Instead, Rem continued with, "He is,"

Rem: [I’ve had several encounters with him before. And, each time, my life has been thrown into danger.]

Katya: [Huh…]

While she looked at Katya, Rem tried hard to choose the right words while also telling the truth. Upon hearing this, Katya's eyes widened, and she looked at Todd, who stood beside her.

Her lips trembled as she questioned her fiancé from beside him.

Katya: [I-is that true? Todd, you, what Rem said…]

Todd: [If it's about that young lady, it's true. You said it right, about having a grudge. I'm a soldier. Sometimes I have to turn my weapon on someone. It's one of those unwanted situations.]

Katya: [It's selfish of you to say you don't want…]

Todd: [If it was in the Fortress City, it was because I saw all of you as a threat. If it was before that, I was just following orders like any other soldier. I have nothing personal against you.]

As he said this, Todd took the axe that was visible from his waist. For a moment, Subaru and the others' entire bodies tensed, but Todd threw it down without hesitation, keeping one hand outstretched.

A parabolic arc was drawn as the axe slid across the ground and rolled under the feet of Subaru and his team.

Louis: [Aau.]

Louis picked up the axe and alternated between looking at Subaru's face and Rem's.

Apparently, it was not an axe-shaped bomb, but it was seemingly a pure act of disarmament.

Todd waved his fluttering, raised hands at Subaru and the others who recognized him.

Todd: [As you can see, I'm not your enemy. But we don't want to waste time in a standoff with each other, do we?]

Flop: […Wife-san, I too think we should talk constructively. What do you think?]

Rem: [――――]

Squeezing her own arm, Rem glanced sideways at Subaru.

Only Subaru and Rem were able to share their wariness of Todd and the level of threat that he posed. As for their acquaintances themselves, Louis was also there when Subaru, Flop, and the others who were attacked by Todd in the Fortress City, but none of that danger was shown on either of their faces.

Therefore――,

Beatrice: [Betty will do what Subaru decides, in fact.]

As she held hands with Subaru, Beatrice gave him only the courage to make a choice, without influencing him either way.

She was not alone; both Tanza and Idra left the future to Subaru's choice. ――Just the fact that these two and Todd were in the same place was enough to make his heart freeze.

If possible, he would have liked to get Todd's presence far away from them as soon as possible, but――,

Subaru: […Katya-san is a friend of Rem. I want as many of us as possible to get out of here unscathed. I don't think we have the time to squabble here.]

Rem: [――. I-I understand.]

Subaru hung his head and bit his lip, and Rem also stiffened her cheeks in frustration.

However, he also did not know what kind of action Todd would take if he refused him poorly. That was a concern that Rem also shared. Now that he was here, he could not let him go.

It was the same reason one cannot leave a bomb unattended, not knowing when it will detonate.

Katya: [D-don’t worry! Th-this guy is outrageously tough! I'm sure he'll help me and all of you escape!]

Todd: [Hey, come on, don't compare your fiancée to a Zodda bug or something.]

Katya poorly followed up on Subaru and Rem’s concerns about Todd. With a wry smile at Katya's defense, Todd then ran his hand through his own hair.

Todd: [Well, if they've accepted me, I have to return the favor. Thanks, I'll have to prove myself to Katya for treating me so lightly.]

Todd said along the same lines a reliable, young man, Subaru, putting aside the inescapable feeling of tension that made him gulp, joined the others.

△▼△▼△▼△

――There were three reasons why Subaru could not reject Todd Fang's presence in this situation.

The first was the presence of Katya, Todd's fiancée.

Having apparently developed a friendly relationship with Rem during her time in the mansion, she appeared to be a good person, despite her sharp-tongued nature, having properly shown Subaru and company that she was not a nefarious sort of person. From all appearances, she did not have the slightest idea of who Todd was at the root of his character, but, whatever Subaru and company accused her of here, it would be a bad bet whether she would believe her fiancé or Subaru and the others.

If so, should one choose to separate from Katya due to disliking Todd?

Watching them leaning their weight on a wheelchair―― not inferior to the one Subaru had built for Rem was so impressive that it was impossible to ignore it.

As long as Katya and Todd were working as one, it was only logical that they could not refuse Todd.

Second, Todd's actions were all undone in a previous attempt due to Return by Death.

With his ruthless nature and cool-headed judgment, Todd had on numerous occasions cornered Subaru, taking Subaru's life―― or sometimes the lives of Subaru's cherished friends.

Flop, who now accompanied them, had also been killed by Todd, as well as Tanza, and even Idra.

Subaru's strong feelings of hatred and fear toward Todd were probably because he had taken the lives of his friends right in front of Subaru's eyes more than any other person Subaru had ever encountered in this world.

However, as a result of Return by Death, these events had not actually occurred, and Todd had not done any harm to Subaru or the others, even though he had turned his deadly weapon on them.

Neither the great fire in the Shudraqian forest, nor the unrelenting attacks in the fortified city, nor the massacre of Gladiators on Gladiator Island, none of these had happened. ――Only that it was possible for him to perpetrate them.

And the third and final reason――,

Todd: [――Aim from the chest up! Anything below the waist will only buy you some time!]

Subaru: [Tsk, Beatrice!]

Beatrice: [Understood, in fact! Minya!]

At the sharp voice's instruction, Subaru and Beatrice simultaneously held their hands out in front of them.

Ahead of their palms, several pale-faced enemies―― zombies were knocked down to the ground as the purple arrows were shot at them, causing them to crystallize and sending up a cloud of dust.

Some of them escaped being critically hit, however――,

Todd: [Sorry, but, even if their torso is in that state…]

Tanza: [Even if the head is intact, it will still be shattered.]

The zombie that was not immediately disabled was hit by the heel of Tanza's falling leg, shattering its crystallized torso and leaving the four limbs of the zombie blown off and useless.

The head of the zombie rolled away, its regeneration process did not begin, and eventually the still intact head lost its color and crumbled away like sand.

Though, he did not want to feel heartache at the sight of it.

Todd: [Now, we should have eliminated the obstacles in the back streets. Your guys' magic, it's working extraordinarily well on these guys, thank you. How much power can you spare?]

Beatrice: […There is plenty more, in fact. Ten or a hundred-thousand to spare, I suppose.]

Todd: [You are reliable. But don't try anything too rash. You guys are my lifeline.]

Subaru and Beatrice had mixed feelings when they were praised for their successful elimination of the group of zombies that was blocking their way.

Unilaterally defeating the zombies was a sound choice, mentally. On the other hand, it was somewhat distressing that Todd was the one praising it.

Putting aside the sentiments of Subaru and the others,

Todd: [I had many encounters with those pale-faced guys before I reunited with Katya at the mansion. They didn't seem to be on either side, the regular army or the rebels, and they didn't really understand each other.]

Flop: [Oh, really? But the ones that Husband-kun and the others took down in the mansion, they seemed to understand what we were saying, though.]

Todd: [Being able to understand words and being able to talk are similar, but they're not the same thing at all, are they? They won't listen to you, and they won't die if you crush their heads or cut them off. They're troublesome enemies to deal with.]

Tanza: [Soldiers who do not die… just as Schwartz-sama's companion told us.]

After being told of the zombies' formidable characteristics, Flop and Tanza contemplated.

However, it was Todd's opinion that they considered, as it was a highly accurate analysis that Subaru could not ignore.

Todd: [To summarize, they can't be defeated by honest means. Swords, lances, and other weapons are only a temporary measure. The best way…]

Flop: [Is Husband-kun’s and the others'.]

Tanza: [Magic.]

Todd: [I've also roasted some of them to charcoal with a Spirit I had in my care, and they didn't get back up. I haven't verified if it's effective with ordinary fire or magic, though.]

Subaru: [――――]

Todd: [Well, in case you're wondering, it takes longer for them to revive if you hit them above the neck than if you hit them in any other part of the body. The legs regenerate surprisingly quickly, so don't expect to take away their mobility.]

Even Subaru, who knew his true nature, was impressed by Todd's willingness to give out such advice.

As soon as the matter of accepting them into the group was settled, Todd generously shared information about the zombies, giving out information as they went along.

Naturally, he, like Subaru and his group, had moved through the Imperial Capital, where numerous zombies roamed, to join up with Katya. Having done so, Todd likely had effective strategies against the zombies and knowledge that would help them escape.

This prospect was the third reason why Subaru had welcomed Todd.

Subaru: [But I had no clue how far it has gone…]

The zombie outbreak occurred shortly after Subaru and his group had climbed over the city walls.

For a moment, Subaru thought that they might have triggered the zombie outbreak, but they decided to trample that down and move forward, as it was an unanswerable fear to consider.

Regardless, from the zombie outbreak to the present, the time available for consideration should have been the same for both Subaru and Todd, but the depth of the information they needed to acquire for survival had been too deep.

It was this attitude, not just toward zombies, but toward anything, anyone, anywhere, that propelled Todd's extraordinary decisiveness and ability to execute.

Rem: [Katya-san, are you all right?]

Katya: [Ye- Yeah, except I'm a little shaken up by all the unfamiliar people… You're one of those people who's cool with this, aren't you?]

Rem: [I'm much more afraid of the likes of Priscilla-sama and Madelyn-san, I don’t have a chance with them.]

Katya: [You have quite the disgusting spirit...]

Rem and Katya slowly followed behind Subaru and his battle group, trying to make their way ahead. Rem was pushing Katya's wheelchair, and Louis was escorting the defenseless girls as they looked around restlessly.

Because of the poor footing and choice of route to bypass the group of zombies, combined with the speed of the fake princes led by Idra and the Galewind horse, the speed of travel was not fast.

Still, steadily, they approached the walls of the Imperial Capital.

Flop: [Husband-kun, you look uncomfortable. Are you still concerned about Soldier-kun?]

Subaru: [Flop-san…]

From the complicated expression on Subaru's face, which was both happy and bitter at the same time, Flop, who was still watching his surroundings closely, came to see through it.

Being the astute man that he was, Flop could see that Subaru was more wary of Todd than necessary―― at least, more than was necessary with the amount of information he had at this point.

Of course, he could not tell Flop that he had been killed, because it would run afoul of the rules of Return by Death.

Subaru: [Flop-san, as I said before…]

Flop: [Pay attention to what Soldier-kun is up to, right? I know that, and that's why Miss Tanza stays with him as much as possible, as you asked her to.]

Subaru: [――――]

Flop: [Although you have become smaller and your face younger, your way of thinking has grown more mature and cautious, Husband-kun. You always do your best to worry, and that's a virtue. But I still admire you for suggesting cross-dressing in order to conquer the fortified city.]

Seeing Flop's soft and gentle smile, Subaru looked embarrassed and then smiled.

Despite Subaru’s appearance, compared to his original body, Flop's age was a reminder of his older brother's power, and it was no wonder that Medium had so much respect for Flop.

Beatrice: [――Hk, Subaru, watch your step, I suppose.]

Subaru: [My step… I mean, Waah.]

When the conversation came to a close, Beatrice led Subaru by the hand and saw―― water flowing under his feet on the sloped ground, soaking the soles of his shoes.

Beyond the Crystal Palace, the reservoirs that held large amounts of water had been breached, and the volume of water flowing into the city was beginning to rise in earnest. The enemy was not only Imperial Soldiers and zombies, but water as well.

If they took too long to withdraw, they would eventually be swallowed by the rising waters――.

Todd: [If we don't get out of here before that happens, it's over for all of us.]

Todd, who walked over to them, clearly verbalized Subaru's sense of crisis.

Subaru stiffened slightly, and whether or not Todd realized his alarm, he pointed the tip of his returned axe toward the Crystal Palace.

Todd: [It looks like General First-Class Moguro's odds are not good against the Cloud Dragon. It's only a matter of time before he loses. One-on-one is not so bad, but two-on-one is fatal… How will the enemy move after the defeat of the General?]

Subaru: [How do you know?]

Todd: [Aside from the Cloud Dragon, the other flying dragon riders are corpses by the looks of it. So far, the corpses have been attacking as soon as they see us. In other words…]

Subaru: [The zombies are trying to kill the living.]

Todd: [It's annoying, but that's how it is.]

Todd turned his head, and Subaru understood what he was trying to say.

The objective of the zombies was to exterminate all of the living. For that reason, if there was a way to kill a lot of people, it would not be surprising that they would choose it.

If the stone giant fighting with the white Dragon right in front of the castle lost, the zombies would completely destroy the walls of the reservoir, causing the water to flood at once.

If that happened, Subaru’s group and the people of the Imperial Capital, along with the soldiers of the regular army and the rebel army who were fighting outside, would all be swept away.

Todd: [I'm angry. But I like the way you call them zombies. We need some kind of name for them. Let's just call them zombies from now on.]

Beatrice: [What do you think about those zombies, in fact?]

Suddenly, Beatrice, who had been silent, asked Todd that question.

Todd, who muttered the word "zombie" several times to familiarize himself with the word, looked puzzled at Beatrice's question,

Todd: [What I think?]

Beatrice: [So far, most of the zombies we've encountered were probably Imperial Soldiers just like you, I suppose. I can tell by the way they dress, in fact. How do you feel about killing your own allies…]

Todd: [First, they aren’t my allies. They just wear the same clothes, and when they die, they're not soldiers or anything. They don’t need to be recognized as anything other than troublesome obstacles.]

Beatrice: [――――]

Todd: [Talking about whose minions they are and what their goals are, I don't think that's important for survival right now. That's something for the superiors to think about and solve.]

He responded flatly, and Beatrice silently agreed to end the conversation.

Todd shrugged his shoulders at her attitude and looked at Subaru again,

Todd: [You’ve got a reliable partner, but you should talk it out if you’re feeling frazzled. For a quick solution, just spitting out what’s on your mind would do you some good.]

Subaru: […I'll keep that in mind.]

In response to Subaru's gloomy answer, Todd ended the conversation with "Do it," and continued on.

Acting as a scout for the road ahead, Todd would find the positions of the zombies and make a plan for how to repel them, to which Subaru and his team would then review and implement in order to secure their escape route.

However――,

Beatrice: [Subaru, if you are having a hard time, you can talk to Betty about anything, I suppose.]

Beatrice looked into Subaru’s face, that looked mentally worn down.

That was partly because he continued to devote strong vigilance towards Todd, and partly because Beatrice's magic was using his mana.

But the greatest psychological burden of all was defeating the zombies.

It was painful destroying zombies that could speak and have something close to a living will.

How much better it would be if, like Todd, he could simply dismiss them as scarecrows blocking the way.

Flop: [I think that's one of the virtues of Husband-kun, though.]

Subaru: […I don’t know. Rem’s going to kick my ass for hesitating again.]

Flop: [Wife-san wouldn’t do that!]

Subaru: [――――]

Flop: [I don’t think she would.]

Strangely, Flop's repeated words were persuasive.

Flop had survived in this merciless Empire with neither force nor magic, but with words alone. Perhaps the single greatest weapon he possessed was his humanity.

Subaru: [Thanks to Flop-san, I’m feeling a bit better!]

Flop: [Thank goodness! I'm useless, so if Husband-kun gets depressed, I won't be able to find a way to save myself! Oops, but…]

Subaru: [But?]

Flop: [Thanks to me, I think I may have hurt Dress-chan’s feelings a bit.]

At Flop's point, Subaru turned around and said, "Huh?" There was Beatrice, holding hands with Subaru and glaring at him with her cute, round eyes.

Subaru's cheeks stiffened at her reaction, and Beatrice blushed,

Beatrice: [Lucky you, who has abandoned Betty who had worried about you, in fact. Subaru is like that again, immediately befriending a guy with a nice face and ignoring Betty, I suppose.]

Subaru: [What incredible reputational damage! No, I'm not ignoring you by any means, okay? In the first place, guys like Flop-san and Ceci are just exceptions to the rule, Idra and Weitz are charming while not necessarily beautiful, but… Hiain is attractive, though.]

Beatrice: [There’s no need to make excuses, in fact!]

With his face turned away, Subaru moaned in pain as if his chest had been strongly gouged out.

Beatrice was also worried about him. Although Flop phrased his words more skillfully, he felt regret towards Beatrice from the bottom of his heart.

No matter what, after escaping from this place, he had to entirely devote himself to pleasing Beatrice.

Subaru: [For now, all I can do is earnestly caress you with my hand…]

???: [...What are you doing in a situation like this?]

Subaru: [Wow!]

Subaru was surprised when someone called out to him from behind. Rem, who cast Subaru a dubious look, kept Louis clinging to her waist as she looked around the vicinity warily,

Rem: [Even if your appearance becomes like that, your personality doesn't change.]

Subaru: [Oh? Does that mean you know my nature well enough to understand who I am?]

Rem: [Correction. Now that your body has shrunk, your tact has become nonexistent compared to before.]

Subaru: [That's the part I'd like you to laugh at and let it slide, blaming it on the uninhibited nature of a child.]

Even Rem's harsh opinion was a pleasant provocation for Subaru after having been separated from her for some time.

Subconsciously, Subaru tightened his face appearing to be happy, being careful not to make Rem uneasy.

In addition to that, speaking of someone he didn’t want to make anxious,

Katya: [Hey, is Todd bothering you? Isn’t he really helpful?]

Subaru: [――――]

Katya, in a wheelchair pushed by Rem, hesitantly asked.

Compared to the false Crown Princes who were released from confinement and followed Subaru and his group in retreat on their own, Katya had experienced a considerable sense of helplessness in not being able to move on her own.

She seemed to be terribly worried about Todd as well as herself, as it was clear that she had a hidden love for Todd, her fiancée.

Seeing the genuine concern of Katya, Subaru turned toward the end of the alley where Todd was headed,

Subaru: [Yeah, he’s helpful. He has a good nose and good eyesight. His precise instructions have really helped us avoid trouble.]

Katya: [Ye, yes. If that's the case, fine…]

Katya, with her eyes downcast, pat herself on the chest in relief.

As aggravating as it was, that was not just to reassure Katya, but a fair assessment of Todd's work up to that point.

In fact, as a soldier, Todd's work had been impeccable, and his scouting and route selection had contributed greatly to their survival in their current situation of having to flee with the hindrance of moving a large number of people.

He did not have an effective way to strike the zombies, but he was outstanding at exposing them to being attacked by Subaru and Beatrice, who did have effective skills. ――Except for Subaru suffering more mental wear and tear than necessary, there were no disadvantages to Todd's presence.

Subaru: [――――]

――No, Rem, whose interactions with Katya seemed to be complicated, was also under the same mental strain over Todd's presence as Subaru.

Subaru: [At this rate…]

Will we really be able to escape out of the Imperial Capital without incident and remain together?

While Subaru struggled with unanswerable questions about how he wished things to proceed――,

Todd: [――Katya, I told you to stay farther back. Don't catch up to us.]

Todd, who had been away scouting, returned and found Katya with Subaru and the others, and warned his fiancée.

At Todd's words, Katya's expression showed relief that Todd was safe, then quickly turned into a look of repulsion, and then changed her expression again.

She seemed to be a bit worried about Todd’s appearance.

Katya: [Todd, what’s going on?]

Todd: [...Good grief, she's so intuitive only at times like these.]

With that said, Todd ran a hand through his bandana-less hair and revealed what he had seen as he looked toward Subaru and the others.

That was――,

Todd: [――There’s some rather tough-looking zombies down the road. That one-eye clan, who were probably the ones who stood out the most in today’s battle.]
