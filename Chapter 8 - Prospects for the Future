*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――When the Cloud Dragon flew into the Imperial Capital, leaving Madelyn behind, Emilia decided to follow Cecilus who was chasing after it, but she fell behind and chose to hide within the city herself.

Emilia: [Hey, you there! Take this child and step back! Be careful not to let her struggle. I've made her limbs numb so handle her gently!]

At that time, don't forget to entrust the half-frozen Madelyn to the rebel who was watching the situation.

Madelyn, who was frozen in ice, showed no signs of waking up, and since her limbs were strongly frozen, there should have been minimal concern about her causing a disturbance in the headquarters.

Emilia: […It feels like a reaaally unpleasant atmosphere.]

After leaving Madelyn in someone else's care, Emilia created an ice staircase and climbed over the city walls. She felt a sense of unease from the atmosphere that pervaded the Imperial Capital.

The air itself should not have changed between inside and outside the city walls, but there was certainly a prickling sensation on the skin, which tried to unsettle Emilia's heart.

However, she could not afford to be defeated by the prickling sensation in her heart and back down.

Emilia: [Mezoreia and Cecilus have both gone towards the castle.]

The battle with the Cloud Dragon Mezoreia would have ended in Emilia's complete defeat if Cecilus had not intervened. Thanks to Cecilus, Emilia managed to hold on, but she was constantly reflecting on the fact that she was almost defeated.

Emilia: [I begged everyone to let me come all the way to Vollachia.]

Of course, everyone was worried about Subaru and Rem, who were sent flying. If she were to say something like that now, no one would blame Emilia alone.

Nevertheless, Emilia had a responsibility as the most important person in the camp.

Emilia had to be aware of Roswaal's importance as her supporter, as well as his different kind of importance. She needed to acknowledge the greatness of everyone's efforts in order to fulfill her own wishes.

Therefore――

Emilia: [Therefore―― I have to work really hard to fulfill what I said I would do.]

After climbing over the tall city walls, Emilia finally entered the streets of the Imperial Capital and saw the cityscape.

As Emilia climbed over the high walls and entered the city, she finally saw the streets of the Imperial Capital. They were quite different from the atmosphere of the Royal Capital of Lugunica, but as a major city, it was evident that there was a well-organized layout of clean buildings and functional areas. Emilia could perceive it all with her own eyes.

Surely, the Emperor of the Empire must have had a clear vision for the future and worked hard to make this city and country a better place.

Emilia: [Even if you try so hard, this is how it turns out, huh…]

The impression someone would get from the cityscape of the Imperial Capital and the reality, however, were too different.

The answer that a part of the Imperial citizens came up with, regardless of what the Emperor felt about governing the Empire, was this rebellion, and Emilia was on the side supporting it.

While one could say that it happened gradually or as a result of circumstances, Emilia did not side with them thoughtlessly; she listened to them, discussed it with her comrades, and made the decision.

Of course, she did not think it would be best to take the Emperor's life as many traitors wanted, but rather to capture him and negotiate with Abel and others.

However, Emilia's hopes and wishes were betrayed in a way she could never have imagined by the events that occurred in the Imperial Capital.

Emilia: […What?]

In the far distance, near the magnificent building called the Crystal Palace located at the very back of the Imperial Capital, one could see a gigantic figure colliding with the Cloud Dragon that took off from the battlefield.

The collision between two giant entities further increased the danger of the siege of the Imperial Capital by one or two levels, but there was something else that surprised her even more.

Underneath the Crystal Palace, where a fierce battle was raging, and all over the Imperial Capital, pale figures attacking the fleeing people were appearing in large numbers.

Emilia: [I don't want to…]

The moment Emilia saw their presence, a chill ran up her spine.

The sensation that Emilia felt was not just a physical disgust, but it was probably her nature as a Spiritual Arts User that caused a rejection reaction towards them.

The Spirit was a natural entity that emerged in the world as a desired existence.

On the other hand, what caused her to shiver was an unnatural entity, impure beings that the world did not recognize, and Emilia intuited that as a Spiritual Arts User.

At the same time, Emilia realized that the internal conflict of the Empire, which had been painful and sad, had transformed into a fierce competition for survival between not just humans but also non-human entities.

Emilia: [――――]

At that moment when she sensed it, the meaning of the battlefield changed within Emilia.

To make the most of what was available, Emilia lifted both arms and created ice stairs haphazardly within range of the star-shaped city walls surrounding the Imperial Capital.

By creating ice stairs wherever she could, Emilia turned the situation of being unable to enter or leave without passing through the city gates into a situation where it was possible to enter or leave from places other than the gates, thereby increasing the escape routes.

Emilia: [Everyone! Run to the wall! You don't have to go to the gate, you can escape from there!]

Calling out in a loud voice, Emilia descended from the city walls into the city.

Suddenly, a pale being appeared as if growing up from the ground and reached out to Emilia. Emilia promptly struck it down with a sword blow of ice.

Emilia: [I think you guys have your own goals but…]

Emilia could not meekly be persuaded to sit down for a dialogue when she was being attacked by others without explanation.

The ones who stood in her way were all dressed in the military uniforms of the Imperial Soldiers, and when they were hit by the dashing Emilia's strike, their bodies shattered and collapsed like pottery. However, their broken bodies immediately started to reassemble, and they returned to their original state, refusing to be fully defeated.

Emilia: [If that’s the case then――]

Even at a disadvantage, Emilia showed her boldness by not retreating there.

Against an opponent who would get up even if they were crushed, Emilia steered towards icing the opponent with sword blows, rather than smashing them with the blade.

Emilia: [Teya! Taa! Urya urya urya!]

Against the quartet of “enemies” that rose up, Emilia kicked the walls, the ground, and the streets of the Imperial City in all directions as she jumped around and laid waste with her assault.

"Enemies" who were attacked by Emilia and had their crushed parts iced over were, as one would expect, unable to have their wounds repaired to their original state. However, some "enemies" destroyed the iced parts themselves and overwrote it with regeneration.

Emilia: [If you will do that, I'll have them retract that approach!]

If the opponent responded, then Emilia would further surpass their riposte.

If freezing a part of the body did not work, she assailed the "enemies" by freezing the entire body. Of course, the energy used against one "enemy" would be greater, but that could not be helped.

Her missing endurance was backed up by willpower determination, and Emilia conquered the streets of the whole area.

Emilia: [Go, quickly! If you go now, you won't be disrupted, run, run!]

Emilia guided the people of the Imperial Capital who were slow to escape, by making the streets she had conquered easy to understand. In the meantime, She herself ran in the opposite direction of those running toward the city walls and ran full speed on the road deeper into the city.

Emilia: [Someone is operating this awfulness…!]

The "enemies" appearing one after another were caused by an unnatural phenomenon.

Meaning, like magic or curse arts someone's will was involved in raising them. If there was a Shaman there, they fundamentally must be stopped.

There was a limit to the extent to which Emilia could freeze.

Fortunately, Emilia, who had an unusually large store of mana, was still able to move, but after fighting Madelyn, Mezoreia's participation, the stairway to the inside and outside of the city walls that she had just built, and then battling "enemies" that appeared one after another, she was feeling tired.

Emilia: [I'm a little more energetic than other people and yet… hk.]

As she felt pity for her lack of strength, Emilia ran up the streets of the Imperial Capital.

She could move faster if she aimed straight for the Crystal Palace, but she would have to protect people who were being attacked by "enemies" along the way. This was the limit of her speed as she was helping them.

While she was thinking about this, she saw another group of people struggling to stay out of sight of the "enemy" on the street――,

Emilia: [Now, I’ll mold a path!]

Four "enemies" who might have gotten in the way of the group going out into the street leapt from the roof of the building just as they turned their backs, and before they could turn around to see Emilia, her ice-blade flashed――.

Emilia: [――――]

The bluish-white, glistening ice sword cleaved the atmosphere, transforming the four "enemies" who were hit by the slash into ice statues.

After watching her "enemies" freeze with a look of surprise on their faces, Emilia converted the ice sword in her hand to mana and turned back to the otherside of the street.

Emilia: [You're safe now! If you keep the ice as a landmark then you can make it out of here!]

???: [T-thank you very much. You saved us.]

Emilia called out to them, and a voice answered from the other side.

Emilia raised her hand in response to their thanks and thought about resuming going to the center once the people crossed the road safely.

That’s what she thought although――,

Emilia: [Wow, that’s a lot of children…]

Opening her eyes wide, in Emilia's vision a group of nearly twenty people escaped from the otherside of the street. Moreover, most of them were children about ten years old, all with dark hair.

Emilia blinked her eyes at the very unusual group, as black hair itself was rare.

There were too many kids whose faces did not resemble one another for them all to be of the same family, which made her think that maybe that was not the case.

Then, one of the few adults in the group waved at Emilia,

???: [Hey, hey, you really saved us! At any rate, we were at our limit just trying to run and hide. I was struggling to decide if I should play the role of a decoy somehow or other.]

Emilia: [Is that so? In that case, I'm glad you didn't. It should be fine from here, so everyone should work together and not be in a hurry.]

???: [Understood. Miss, I thank you from the bottom of my heart! Well then, Wife-san! Miss Katya!]

Katya: [D-don't call out so loud… It’ll be bad if those guys show up again…!]

It was a woman at the end of the line who thus answered the call of the blonde, young man with a cheerful smile. Emilia was slightly surprised when she saw her down low, riding in a wheelchair.

Emilia: [Besides the one Subaru made, this is the first I’ve seen.]

Wheelchairs were useful for transporting people with impaired legs, but that kind of tool was rarely seen. The fact that Emilia even knew about them was because she had seen the actual wheelchair that Subaru had gone to the trouble of designing and assembling for a girl that remained asleep.

Now that Subaru and Rem had been sent flying, that wheelchair too was left at the Roswaal mansion, but――,

Rem: [Katya-san, please don't be so angry… I understand your unease after being separated from your fiancé.]

Katya: [D-don't go saying unnecessary stuff! You've been worried about those kids this whole time too…! Don't act like it’s just me.]

Rem: [That wasn’t my intention.]

Emilia, whose eyes had been fixed on the girl in the wheelchair, was slow to recognize the sight of the girl standing behind her that was pushing the wheelchair.

Holding the handles on the back of the wheelchair and pushing it was a girl with blue hair――,

Emilia: [――Rem?]

Rem: [――――]

Involuntarily, Emilia's lips uttered that name, and her eyes met with the girl who looked up in surprise.

Making sure, Emilia closely examined the face of the wide-eyed girl who was looking back at her. It was the first time Emilia had seen her with her eyes open, but she looked exactly like a girl Emilia knew very well.

That, too, was expected, as Emilia had heard that this girl and the girl that she knew were twins. ――From none other than Emilia's trustworthy Knight.

Rem: [Do you know me?]

Frowning, the girl―― Rem looked at Emilia doubtfully.

Emilia gasped at that question from the girl who had one hand on her chest. Stuck in the middle of the pair’s conversation, the girl in the wheelchair looked back and forth between Emilia and Rem’s faces.

And then,

Katya: [A-another one of your acquaintances? Just how many people are looking for you… Wah!]

Emilia: [Rem!]

With a long stride, Emilia closed the distance between them and took Rem’s hand, flying past the woman muttering something with a sour look.

Rem’s eyes widened at her movement, but Emilia was not composed enough to show consideration for her surprise. Still clutching her hand, Emilia teared up at the sight of Rem standing right in front of her.

Emilia: [Awake… Rem’s awake! Amazing! This is huge! Quick, I have to let Ram and Subaru know!]

Rem: [W-wait please, who in the world…]

Emilia: [Umm, there was a message from Ram saying to meet up outside, so maybe he’s already outside? Geez! Why is Subaru missing at a time like this… Umm, umm…]

Rem: [Please listen to what I’m saying!]

With so many surprising incidents, Emilia’s head was a complete mess, and it was Rem who put the brakes on her thoughts.

She stared angrily at Emilia, who was still clutching her hand, 

Rem: [You also called me Rem… Are you someone who knew me from before?]

Emilia: [Ah, no, that's a bit tough to answer. I don't remember you from when you were awake, either. So, it's weird, but it's kind of like we’re meeting for the first time.]

Rem: [I-I don't know what you mean…]

Emilia: [Umm, I'm not very good at explaining things, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to get this across properly...]

Emilia felt sorry and thought about what to say to the puzzled Rem.

It was a great feeling to be able to talk to Rem while she was awake, but to Emilia, she was Ram's younger sister, the one who had been asleep for more than a year. She was also a woman who had had her Memories stolen from her when she was awake by the power of the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony.

Emilia herself had no real understanding other than that she believed that her Memories of Rem had been taken away from her due to Subaru's story and the fact that she looked just like Ram.

However, there were some things that could be discerned from Rem's account and from what Emilia herself knew.

That was――,

Emilia: [Rem, is it possible that you don't remember what happened before you woke up?]

Rem: […Well, I don't really know how to feel about that expression "before I woke up", but yes.]

Emilia: […So. That's how it is.]

She had a hope that perhaps when Rem had woken up, she would have the Memories of her time with Emilia and the others, and that she might be able to tell her about their previous relationship.

Unfortunately, that hope was not realized, but still,

Emilia: [But you don't have to worry about anything. You may be reaaally worried because you don't understand a lot of things, but I will help you, and Ram and Subaru will both be there for you!]

Rem: [――. What are you, to me?]

Emilia: [If I were just to say our relationship, I would say that we are guest and maid. But I don't think that's the only type of relationship I have with Ram, so I guess I want to have more than just that with you as well, Rem.]

Rem: [――――]

Emilia: [I guess I'm not good at explaining the kind of relationship where we lend each other help when we need it, think together when we have problems, and face difficult things side by side…]

When asked who she was to Rem, Emilia was unsure.

The reason for that was that her relationship with her had been brought down to zero and had to be reassembled from that point once again. So, she would only be able to tell how she wanted to reassemble it, and her prospects of it.

Emilia: [I want to get along with you, Rem. Let's do our very best together.]

This was Emilia's honest belief, and her vision of the future.

Rem: [――――]

Upon hearing Emilia's answer, Rem's eyes widened and her lips opened and closed several times.

However, her thoughts were not so readily put into words, and her lips kept opening and closing. As it was, she was frustrated, and the moment was about to pass, but――,

Flop: [Wife-san, I have a feeling she's on your side.]

Rem: [Flop-san…]

Flop: [I've met many people as a merchant, but it's rare to meet someone who is so straightforward. I'm sure she can be trusted.]

It was the blonde-haired young man named Flop who said this to the stammering Rem.

At his bright and cheerful affirmation, Rem raised her eyebrows and then turned to look at Emilia again. Emilia met that gaze with pride in her chest.

At Emilia's attitude, Rem let out a small sigh,

Rem: […I believe that you are someone who knows me, and that you have no ill will.]

Rem's hesitation to say so made Emilia's heartache for a moment. Emilia's eyes widened, and Rem's pale blue eyes narrowed slightly,

Rem: [Um, you mentioned the name "Subaru" earlier…]

Emilia: [Huh? Yeah, I said Subaru is someone who is reaaally worried about you and has always cared for you…]

Rem: [――. If that is true…]

Rem's eyes lowered at Emilia's answer, and her gaze glanced toward the end of the alley―― the direction from which Rem's group had just come from. It was not quite a glance into the alley, but more like a glance back along the path they had just taken.

Emilia thought about what it might mean, and leaned forward with a "By any chance,"

Emilia: [Were you with Subaru? Is Subaru okay? He's not doing anything reckless, right?]

Rem: [So that's your perception, too. That man is often reckless.]

Emilia: [Hmm, yeah. He's a difficult boy and… Oh! Come to think of it.]

Rem: [What is it?]

Emilia: [My name is Emilia, just Emilia. Since you've forgotten, I should probably start by introducing myself.]

Even though Emilia remembered Rem's name, Rem did not know Emilia's, and if she did not tell her, Rem would not be able to address her properly.

After hearing Emilia's name, Rem looked at her light-heartedly,

Rem: [Emilia-san…]

Emilia: [Uh, yeah. So Rem, about Subaru, is he over there?]

Rem: [They're over there, I'm pretty sure of it…]

Then, upon hearing Rem mince words and seeing her expression cloud over slightly, Emilia raised her eyebrows with a bad feeling.

Looking at the state of the Imperial Capital and the fact that Rem, Flop, the girl in the wheelchair, and the children were the only ones on the move, it was not very Subaru-like for him to be separate from them.

Still, the fact that Subaru was separated from Rem and the others――,

Emilia: [Well then, he's being reckless again… I've got to get to him quickly!]

Rem: [Since you immediately know what to expect, then he is that kind of person after all…]

Emilia: [Yes, Subaru has a habit of showing off, so I'm always worried about him.]

Rem: [So he is that kind of person after all…]

Rem nodded her head in agreement with Emilia's assessment of Subaru.

Emilia was happy to exchange words with Rem like this, but the urgency of this situation did not allow for them to have a prolonged chat.

What made that sentiment even more urgent was that――,

Katya: [――Hk! Wh-what!? What is that!?]

Suddenly, a rather loud explosion echoed in the distance. The woman in the wheelchair, her shoulders jumping at the sound, looked around restlessly.

It must have been hard to see from her vantage point, but from Emilia's, she could see a red pillar of fire rising from the far side of the Imperial Capital, followed by a plume of black smoke.

It was a very big explosion.

The atmosphere did not seem troubled, so it did not seem to be an explosion caused by magic, so perhaps it was ignited by Fire Magic Stones or something.

Rem: [Over there…]

Emilia: [Are there any people with Subaru by any chance?]

Rem: [――. Yes.]

Looking toward the direction of the explosion, the choked-up Rem nodded to Emilia's question.

The moment Emilia saw the explosion, she could not help but think that Subaru had something to do with it. She wanted to rush over there right now and join Subaru.

But, it was also a very difficult choice to leave Rem here alone, considering how Ram and Subaru would feel, and Emilia was almost overwhelmed with wanting to do both this and that.

Katya: […A-are you going toward the explosion? Then, then, take that girl with you. She's useful.]

Emilia: [Huh?]

Rem: [Katya-san?]

The confusion in Emilia's mind was brought to a stop by―― Katya, a woman in a wheelchair who had been extremely startled by the sound of the explosion.

She timidly looked at Emilia, repeatedly making eye contact and then averting her gaze,

Katya: [Look, she can use magic to heal wounds. If you had that, you'd be okay, even if they were a bit reckless. Besides… It's been on my mind this whole time.]

Rem: [...I think it's Katya-san who is concerned about these things.]

Katya: [It's fine on my part! And Todd, you see, that guy is a damn underhanded man. He's bound to come back with a nonchalant look on his face anyway, no matter what. But, that kid, you know, isn't as tough as Todd.]

Rem: [But…]

Katya's faltering speech, while blunt, was sympathetic toward Rem's feelings. Perhaps it was because that thoughtfulness was conveyed well.

Rem was unable to nod at Katya's words, but when Katya saw Rem's reluctance, she raised her voice and said, "Forget it!",

Katya: [I think that from here on out, this person… has already taken care of it, you see. This… you know what, you have silver hair and long ears. It's not a good omen.]

Emilia: [Oh, I didn't want to bring it up, it might trouble you, so don't look at me right now.]

If people found out that Emilia was a half-elf, it might scare them away, even in the Empire. So, she hid both of her ears with her hands so that they might forget about it.

Katya looked at Rem again, wondering about Emilia's reaction,

Katya: [If it's about me, you worry too much. I'll let the nice, scraggly guy over there take me. You do what you want to do, and do it properly…]

Rem: [――――]

Katya: [J-just go ahead and make sure Todd doesn't screw things up. That's all I'm going to say! Come on, now don't dawdle…]

With that, Katya spun the wheels of her wheelchair and moved away from Rem. Rem let out a small "ah" at Katya's decision to go without her, and then cast her eyes down.

However, while she closed her eyes tightly,

Rem: [Flop-san, can I leave Katya-san in your care?]

Flop: [Yeah, she's in good hands! Let's just get through this last push with the fake Crown Prince-kuns we have worked so hard together with.]

Rem: [Yes. ――Katya-san, thank you very much.]

Rem bowed deeply to Flop, who thumped his chest and accepted. Katya's cheeks reddened as she turned away with a "hmm".

That exchange of smiles between Rem and Katya made Emilia lower the corners of her eyes.

Emilia: [When we get out of here, please tell me what you have been doing up until today, Rem. I, Ram, Subaru, and everyone else would reaaally like to hear it.]

Rem: [I don't even think it's going to be an interesting story… But, I understand.]

When Emilia held out her hand, Rem hesitated slightly before grasping it back.

Emilia smiled at the touch and then gently pulled on her by her hand. Unexpectedly, Rem's eyes widened, and she stumbled and fell onto Emilia's chest.

Then, Emilia picked up Rem's body and said, "Alright!",

Emilia: [Sorry. We can't afford to take our time, so let me carry you so we can go a little faster!]

Rem: [Y-you're quite strong, aren't you?]

Emilia: [Yes, I am. ――Take care, everyone! We will meet again!]

With Rem in a princess carry, Emilia called out to Katya and Flop and the others around her. Then, with a “Yaa!", she leapt from that spot and ascended up to the roof of the building.

Flop: [Wife-san! Miss Emilia! Please be careful out there!]

Katya: [Y-you better come back to us…]

With those cheers, Emilia looked down at Rem, who was in her arms,

Emilia: [Hold on tight. I'm going to run a little fast!]

Rem: [――. What kind of relationship did you and I have before?]

Rem squeezed and clung on tightly, murmuring to herself. Emilia did not have a clear answer to give,

Emilia: [That's the same thing I'd like to know about you, too!]

Emphatically expressing herself as such, she started running again deep into the Imperial Capital, with Rem in her arms.

Continuing on, Emilia ran, and ran, and ran, with the feeling of Rem's arms clinging tightly to her, and then――,

Emilia: [That's enough.]

――At that moment, the reunion had been made complete.
