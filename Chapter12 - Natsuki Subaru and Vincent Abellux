*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

The moment he threw that punch, was the moment he had been the most annoyed about having become smaller.

Even more so than during the tragedy of the Gladiator Island, in which he had been able to unite everyone as to overcome it; even more so than the Sparka used to win Gustav over to his side; even more so than his dialogue with Cecilus under the moon; at this very moment, that he could have punched him a just a little bit harder were he to have a larger body, made him annoyed. 

Vincent: [You…!]

Taking the blow from the young Subaru’s fist on his left cheek, the Emperor, his face soiled with blood, widened his eyes.

His gaze was directed at his own feet, observing Subaru after the latter had failed to land, tumbling down onto the floor. However, though his face was possibly one of shock, it was bereft of indignation. More so than the humiliation he felt, his astonishment had been stronger.

The Emperor, having been given more shock than pain from Subaru’s fist, pressing his hand against where it had struck, 

Vincent: [Do you not value your own life!? If I were to raise my hand, the Flame of the Yang Sword would scorch your very being…]

Subaru: [Yup, it’s not dear to me! Compared to letting you go without giving you a wallop right here and now, something like burning to death isn’t scary or anything at all!]

Vincent: [Wha…]

Receiving a scowl from the Emperor, Subaru jumped up before his eyes, and riposted, firmly.

Just then, fatigue yet remaining in his body, he lost his balance and fell backwards, slamming against the door, but that was fine. Leaning against the door like that, Subaru spread his arms, thus obstructing the Emperor. 

That he did not hold his life dear to him, such a thing was a downright lie.

But, in this tit-for-tat, he did not want to show even a hint of weakness. 

This Emperor was speaking all he wanted to say towards him without reserve, so whether it be with fists or words, Subaru would not be satisfied unless he fired back. 

Subaru: [It’s just as you guys say. I think, I can’t be understood. After all, even I myself don’t really understand what my standard is for taking action.]

Vincent: [...“You guys”, you say?]

Biting his lip, the Emperor frowned as Subaru glared at him. 

Lowering his hand from his cheek, his face defiled with blood trickling from Subaru’s hand, the Emperor was at a loss from the fact that the brunt of Subaru’s statement had multiple people as a target, possibly being directed at someone aside from himself.

Though, no matter how much he pondered it over, there was no way he could understand. The man before Subaru’s eyes was the Emperor, the other man nothing more than a foot soldier without officer rank.

And yet, the wounds that both had given Subaru, the wound of what they had pointed out, were one and the same.

Subaru: [I want to prioritize the people I like, the people I hold dear, and protect them. Those are my honest feelings. But, even if it’s someone I hate or someone I don’t know, and they’re put into danger right in front of me, then I…]

Todd had said, that Subaru would choose who to save based on his subjective likes and dislikes.

Abel had said, that Subaru would recklessly choose who to save regardless of likes or dislikes. 

Both of those were correct, and since both were correct, they were mistaken. 

After all――,

Subaru: [But… is that really such a bad thing…?]

Vincent: [What?]

Subaru: [Is that so bad? Without the resolve to try and carry the whole world on my back, and without any grand significance, is it really so bad that I save those that are right in front of me on impulse!?]

As Subaru rose his voice, violently stomping his feet, the Emperor widened his sable eyes.

Though still amidst a rapid sequence of expression and demeanours uncharacteristic of him, Subaru yet pressed him for an answer.

Subaru: [It’s just as you said! I consider the things within my own range of vision, I reach as far out as I can, that’s what I’ve been doing until today. What’s so bad about that!?]

Vincent: [Are you taking the offensive!? What is so bad, you say? Is it not obvious!? For what reason do you focus not on the bigger picture, and instead act upon your selfish emotions? The Authority bestowed upon you, for what reason do you not put it to good use!?]

Subaru: [I use absolutely everything! I’m standing here because I put it to good use! Don’t get emotional, huh!? Stop talking like an idiot! The way I choose to use my own emotions, is up to me!]

Vincent: [Then at least act in accordance with those emotions! If you are to decide between somebody’s life or death based on your likes and dislikes, do not deviate from that method in any sort of way. Your way of being, is riddled with distortions.]

Subaru: [If that’s your conclusion from me leading a righteous life, I’m all for having a warped personality!]

As the Emperor still continued to rebuke Subaru’s attitude, while replying the latter delivered a powerful kick. Kicking the Emperor’s shin over and over again, his anger, too much to be contained, erupted in full. 

As Subaru unleashed kicks charged with his foul temper, the Emperor contorted his cheeks, and,

Vincent: [We shall speak no further.]

With that, he attempted to terminate the conversation one-sidedly. Once more, he did it one-sidedly.

Trying to leave behind the divide between their sense of values in that manner, the Emperor seized Subaru’s shoulders. He to move him out of the way, and with the physical strength of a child, the latter could not go against an adult.

That was why, Subaru bit down on that hand with all of his might.

Vincent: [――Hk, You!]

Subaru: [Schtop beain sho selfesh!]

Biting down without restraint, he engraved the Emperor’s right hand with a bite wound. His right hand bleeding as he forcibly shook it free, much like the one bearing a wound from the knife, both of the Emperor’s hands were shedding blood. 

Causing the great and noble apex of the Empire to shed blood, Subaru would be unable to avoid the death penalty. 

Subaru: [That’ll only happen if the country still exists, you stupid idiot!]

Vincent: [What are you… guoh!!]

The moment he had been shaken off, Subaru’s small body grabbed the Emperor from the front, pressed his head against the latter’s abdomen, and clipped his knees. A fighting style he had learned from Weitz, who had devised it. 

Proceeding to apply Weitz’s teachings even further, he attained dominance through street rules.

With the Emperor having fallen onto his back, sitting upon his chest as to weigh him down, Subaru grabbed him by the collar and slammed him into the floor. Were the back of one’s head to be struck over and over again, no matter who it was they would be knocked-out, instantly.

However――,

Vincent: [Do not get carried away!]

He was shocked upon being struck the first time, he was confused upon being struck the second time. And though he was successful in lowering the back of his head, the third time around, he was stopped by a simple difference in strength, he was thrown off of the Emperor’s body, having been grabbed by his hair.

Screaming out with a “Gyaan!” he tumbled to the floor, Subaru saw the Emperor stand back up in his peripheral vision, and, once again, the latter attempted to head for the door.

Subaru: [Like I’d let you!]

Jumping onto the Emperor’s knees from behind, by means of sheer force he halted the body moving towards the door. Due to Subaru’s excessive momentum however, the Emperor was knocked over forwards. 

The result――,

Vincent: [Buh.]

Then, with a dull thud, the Emperor crashed face-first into the cabin’s door.

Vincent: [――――]

A firm sound echoed, the sound of him placing his hands against the door his face had been pressed against, and thus the Emperor rose to his feet once more, after having fallen face-first onto it. Then turning around, the Emperor seized Subaru by the collar with both his hands, hoisting him up.

Subaru leaked out “Uah”s of pain as the two spun halfway around, with his back slammed against the door, pushed against it. 

The nose and forehead of the Emperor before his eyes were reddened, ; from point-blank range he glared at Subaru, the latter’s legs suspended. 

Vincent: [What do you want? What is your objective? What is it that you desire!?]

Subaru: [I want to hit you! My objective is to hit you! My desire is to hit you!]

Vincent: [You…!]

Subaru: [What about you, what do you want? What is your objective? Just what the hell is it that you desire!?]

Vincent: [――――]

Caught by his collar, clawing at the Emperor’s hands, Subaru’s spittle flew as he shouted in reply.

Then twisting his head, he opened his mouth in an attempt to bite the Emperor’s hand one more time, but no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to reach it. At the very least, drool amassed in the Emperor’s hand as he spat. 

In that way, while having his hand sullied by Subaru’s saliva, the Emperor’s cheek stiffened for a reason separate to that disgrace. He muttered.

Vincent: [My, desire…?]

Subaru: [That’s right. There’s gotta be something you wanted to do apart from that massively important topic. If not, you wouldn’t go out of your way to come to me at such a busy time.]

Vincent: [――――]

Subaru: [Your number one, you don’t understand it yourself, do you? While you were talking just now, you mentioned something you put the most energy into, the most emotion into. That’s the one most important thing for you.]

The topic of evacuating from the Imperial Capital, or the topic of suspecting Subaru being a Stargazer. The topic of dealing with Emilia and the others, who had hailed from the Kingdom, to the topic of the divide stemming from being unable to understand Subaru’s way of being.

Now that he thought of it, there had been no words expressing sympathy for Subaru after his recovery from having fallen unconscious; in the first place, this bastard had not said anything in regards to this being their first meeting after the Demon City either. 

But putting all those numerous affairs aside, the one topic he was most passionate about was obvious.

Subaru: [――Chisha.]

Vincent: [...Why, Natsuki Subaru.]

The heat that had boiled over just before during their grappling match, disappeared, however, in its place was a cold heat, a heat set alight by that question, now uttered once more. 

If that which accompanied violence was a flame of scarlet tonality, then that question had come accompanied by a flame of azure tonality. 

That azure glow blazing in his eyes, it scorched Subaru as he stood before the Emperor, while the latter posed his question.

Vincent: [I was the one who trained him. If it were him, he would have been able to do the same work as me without even the slightest deviation. Depending on the circumstances, it could even be said that in regards to military power, he was superior.]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [There was no difference between mine and that damn Chisha’s ability. Whichever of us remained would take over the fight to oppose the Great Disaster, devoting their all. ――Why.]

Staring directly into Subaru’s black eyes, the Emperor’s―― No, Abel’s black eyes wavered.

The mask of Emperor, which he had likely worn alongside a resolve to nevermore remove it, was ripped off of him not long after he had steeled himself like so. And thus, Subaru gazed upon Abel’s face. 

And finally, not as the Emperor of this country, but as a single person who had been bereaved of someone dear, Abel could not help but question Subaru.

Vincent: [Why, did you let me live despite loathing me, and let Chisha die, Natsuki Subaru.]

After gaining self-awareness of what he had wanted to ask Subaru himself, Abel hurled the same question towards Subaru as he had done before their scuffle had broken out. 

The sorrow, the fragility contained within that voice, were incomparable to what they had been just before. 

The Emperor known as Vincent Vollachia, utilized absolutely everything in his possession for the sake of the Empire.

Ruling over the great country that possessed the vastest lands among those known in this world as the Four Great Countries, Vincent Vollachia reigned as Emperor, an omnipresent and all-seeing existence.

For that Emperor known as Vincent Vollachia to issue that question not for the sake of the Empire, but rather as a mere single person, was evidence that this singular question carried a weight rivaling that of the Empire itself. 

His skin, his blood, his brain, his very soul perceiving that, Subaru’s heart trembled.

At the same time, in contrast to Abel’s swell of emotion, Subaru’s emotions were muted. 

Subaru: [――――]

Just why was it that the person known as Chisha had to die?

Unbeknownst to Subaru, Abel and Chisha had both been placed on different plates of a scale, and one of those two people had been met with a dead-end. 

Thus, Abel had intended that the scales of perdition would tip over to his side. 

And that envisioning had been painted over. ――Most likely, by the deceased Chisha himself.

――Abel had likely prepared for his own death since long ago.

Because someone had been born, someday, their life would assuredly reach its end. All were aware of such a fact. But it was just as if Abel’s situation was completely different to the reality everybody unconsciously ignored. 

Resolve towards destined death, that was no different to what Subaru confronted due to Return by Death. 

Always, Abel had stood before and met his own forthcoming death in the eyes.

With the same resolve as Subaru, who fought to the bitter end while believing that the arrival of Death was something that could be changed, that it was something that must be changed no matter what, Abel had continued to fight. 

If Subaru were to go without dying, Emilia, Rem, and Beatrice would end up dying.

Otto and everyone else, Tanza and everyone else, all of the Shudraq, Flop and Medium, a great number of people would end up dying. In exchange for his own life, he would attempt to allow everyone to survive.

If he had come to expend the entirety of his resolve for that purpose, Abel was.

Subaru: [I completed all preparations with that end in sight. But even so――]

Emilia, Rem, Beatrice, all of them had all taken Subaru’s place, permitting his survival.

In order to let Subaru live, Otto and everyone else, Tanza and everyone else, all of the Shudraq, Flop and Medium, a great number of other people, had become sacrifices so he could survive.  

Even if nobody else was capable of understanding that despair, Natsuki Subaru was the single person who had to keep it in mind.

Nullifying that possibility, painting over that reality by means of his Authority, Natsuki Subaru was the single person who would not deny the despair that Abel was going through without paying any heed.

Understanding, gulping down, there was something he must say in addition. 

Subaru: [――I’m not a Stargazer, Abel.]

Vincent: [――――]

The words he spoke, assuredly had seemed like a betrayal to Abel, this late in the game. 

This late in the game, Subaru had not returned the reply of Abel’s desire, instead keeping it to himself. But, however much Abel suspected Subaru, reality would not budge.

Perhaps Subaru was able to do the same things a Stargazer could.

Perhaps Subaru possessed means with which to intervene with fate to an extent greater than a Stargazer’s own means.

Even so, he was not omnipotent. It was impossible for him to be omnipotent.

It would be nice if he was omnipotent, but he was not enough to be omnipotent.

Subaru: [That’s why, I couldn’t save this Chisha person you talked about. I wouldn’t know how to save him, either. But, I’ll just say this one thing…]

Vincent: [...What is it.]

Subaru: [...Supposing I really did have a power like the one you speak of, even then, I would choose to save you, who I detest, rather than someone I don’t know. Without reasons like looking ahead to the future, that’s what I would do. That’s, what I will do.]

Truly, even he himself thought it was a nature that could not be helped. 

But, that was the result of no falsehood that Natsuki Subaru, within his vessel that he understood, had come to by consulting with the ability he possessed; that had been the result.

Vincent: [――――]

Slowly, the hands of Abel grabbing his collar lost their strength, and Subaru’s body was released.

While his back grazed the door, Subaru’s body slid down. Even now, Abel’s hands were fastened to Subaru’s collar, but those fingers had lost so much power to the extent they turned white.

If he wanted to remove those hands he could have done it easily, however, Subaru did not remove them.

With them still fastened, Subaru merely called his name out with “Abel”――.

Vincent: [If you say that you are not a Stargazer…]

Such was the frail sound produced by Abel’s lips.

But, Abel himself had not been satisfied with the uttered sound, and did not continue further. Abel’s black eyes began to wander in search of the words he truly desired.

He would put his emotions into words. 

Something that even a toddler could do, perhaps the Emperor of the Empire, who had not once done so until now, would now do so.

Vincent: [You, would try and save me no matter what…]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [In the situation contending for the destiny of the Empire, occupying me with such insignificant trifles…]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [I… I! Even since I laid eyes upon your way of being…] [1]

[1] TL note: Changes pronouns here 

Subaru: [――――]

Each time, his words would come to a loss halfway through. 

No matter the words, no matter the emotions, they were not enough to express what Abel felt deep in his heart. Abel repeatedly got stuck, revised his words, and corrected himself, but Subaru did not rush him.

Vincent: [You, detest me, viewing me as an enemy…]

His intelligent self realizing that there was no desired response beyond his faltering words, Abel restarted on the words he ought to say, over and over again. 

Known as the wisest Emperor since the beginning of the Vollachian Empire, that man whose wisdom was respected by everyone, did so.

Thus, doing it over and over again, finally, he arrived.

Vincent: [I…]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [I… had gained the resolve for my own death… I didn’t have the resolve, to lose someone dear.]

Having only forged his resolve to be on the side leaving the rest behind, his resolve for being left behind had not been cultivated.

Perhaps he had even gone as far as to think about what he would leave behind in his last moments. If one were to search, there was even the possibility they would find notes here and there left for after his death. 

All of that was for the sake of entrusting the matter to those who would continue forth, with a resolve that had not even considered the possibility he would be on the side being entrusted. 

Vincent: [Why.]

A quavering voice, question so.

While speaking in a quavering voice, Abel removed his hands from Subaru’s collar. Those hands, his own very blood-stained hands, he brought them to his face, and concealed his expression.

The Emperor, who would by no means even close both his eyes in front of others, covered his face with both his hands.

Vincent: [Why, did you leave me behind and die, Chisha…!?]

His face in his hands, his voice trembling, his black eyes potentially even tearing up, Vincent Vollachia fell to his knees.

Having lost a very, very important person, the man who had likely not had even the time to grieve, not needing to wear the mask of the emperor in front of a rude and disrespectful individual whom he hated, he fell to his knees.

As he looked upon that, Subaru, taking a very long, and immensely deep breath――,

Subaru: [――I’m sorry.]

With that, as a fellow struggler fighting against an unreasonable fate, he faced the fellow struggler who had been wounded while earnestly continuing to fight, and imparted words that would never be able to be of comfort. 

△▼△▼△▼△

When Subaru had swung at Abel as the latter tried to leave, what came to Subaru’s mind was the memory of when Otto had once similarly punched him. 

Subaru: [You’re incredible dude. I could never be as <u>smart</u> as you… Though, I’d never say that to his face.]

Since he would feel embarrassed and annoyed, he was absolutely reluctant to say that directly to the said person. 

The most he would be willing to consider was that one day, when Otto is dying of old age, he would sit at the side of the bed and say “To be honest, I thought you were incredible”. If he were to really go through with it, he had faith that Otto, even in his dying moments, would retort with “Then why have you been keeping silent about it until now!?”

Anyhow――,

Subaru: [――――]

With a thud, Abel leaned his back against the wall of the cabin as he sat on the ground, and observed the dim interior of the cabin while hugging one of his knees.

Subaru, too, absentmindedly reflected upon the silence while sitting next to him with legs crossed. 

From the outset, Subaru’s true feelings were undoubtedly those of gratitude and toying towards Otto.

When Subaru collapsed while trying to carry anything and everything by his lonesome, Otto gave a wallop to Subaru’s cheek, and told him the words he needed to hear.

Facing a friend who was putting up a useless front, and telling them so. ――That experience had given Subaru the courage to spring off of the bed. 

But then again――,

Subaru: [It’s not like you and I are friends or anything.]

Vincent: [――. Of course. Speak not of such repulsive things. To be a friend of yours… No, I simply have no need for the likes of friends. Nor shall I ever want them.]

Subaru: [So your reasoning isn’t that you can’t make friends, but that you won’t make them? I also did that when I pretended to be proudly independent, but it’s completely obvious to the people around you.]

Vincent: [Your disrespect knows no bounds, now does it?]

Seated next to each other, without facing each other, Subaru and Abel exchanged words.

No longer did he have the heat of passion from the scuffle and grappling, but that said, he could not keep up the good manners, to the extent of aborting the conversation midway and leaving. 

Subaru’s face, clothes, and hands were stained with blood all over. 

Of course, Abel’s face, hair, and clothes were also stained with blood all over.

Inside the cabin, the sheets were stained with blood, and the knife had fallen to the ground. Blots of sprayed blood had been made here and there, and evidence of devastation and bloodshed were everywhere. 

The amount of blood was not enough to be considered a murder scene, but it was enough to look like a crime scene. 

Subaru: [But, even if we thrash around we could never destroy the whole cabin. That’s what our individual limit is, you and I.]

Even when Subaru and Abel rampaged without restraint, the most they could do was break the furnishings.  

If the truly dangerous people of this world were to rampage, the cabin would probably be destroyed without leaving a trace in the blink of an eye. How much time would it take for Emilia, with that cute face and those cute hands of hers, to innocently tear down this cabin.

Subaru: [When you and I throw down, it’s not even cute or anything.]

Vincent: [...Just what in the world is your problem?]

Subaru: [What about you, what the hell is your problem? I’ll tell you what, it’s because your mind is so damn scattered that I can’t even tell what you wanna talk about.]

Vincent: [――――]

Abel remained silent, and pondered. 

The reason he held his tongue was likely because he gained awareness of how scattered the topics were. It was the result of plugging his ears to the appeals of his true intentions, and only choosing the topics that felt good to his ears, and flowed nicely; since he was getting distracted, there had not been a single topic that was sincere.

That was the reality of Abel’s speech up until just before, and a mistake of his that he had also become aware of.

Thence, how he would recover from that, Subaru waited to see――,

Vincent: [Natsuki Subaru, is it the truth that you are not a Stargazer?]

Subaru: [...It’s true. I’m not a Stargazer or anything. Something like premonitions of the future, that’d be more like the Witch Cult than me. I don’t really get along with those guys.]

Vincent: [I have heard rumors that in Lugunica, you had felled two Sin Archbishops.]

Subaru: [This is private, but it’s actually three. Gluttony too… Nah, it’s kinda difficult to say whether Gluttony has been defeated or not, so forget about that. Louis’s situation is also… AH!]

Vincent: [What?]

Subaru: [You didn’t do anything to Louis, right? After all, I still haven’t forgiven you for when you said Louis would be killed.]

In the Demon City of Chaosflame, the reason for Subaru going off on his own from Abel and the others was Abel’s resolute stance towards Louis.

When her identity as a Sin Archbishop came to light, Abel had said she could not be permitted.

With that as the reason, Subaru went off separately from Abel and the others; isolated and helpless together with Louis, they headed towards Yorna’s castle――,

Subaru: [Even though a few things have happened, I still won’t forgive you.]

Vincent: [Speak not of foolish things. Though, was it not you who utterly loathed that girl.]

Subaru: [Before was before, now is now. To begin with, if you kept your impression of me from our first meeting, you’d doubt my sanity finding out that I am a member who gets along well.]

Vincent: [Your sanity is something I have doubted since the Shudraq Village. ――Your concern was unnecessary.]

Subaru: [Hah?]

Vincent: [No harm would have been inflicted upon that girl. After all, what I had tried to say back then was not insisting that we immediately execute one who appeared to be a Sin Archbishop.]

Subaru: [Wha…!]

Vincent: [You jumped to a hasty conclusion. Diligently reflect upon this.]

 Told that his caution was needless, Subaru was at a loss for words. But, even supposing that were true, Abel’s coldhearted and indifferent attitude was part of the reason for Subaru’s hasty conclusion.

Abel’s attitude up until then had accumulated, and connected to his distrust back then.

Subaru: [That, was an issue of your attitude though…]

Vincent: [It was necessary. Even if just a slight chance, it was to have you not think of wanting me kept alive.]

Subaru:  [――――]

Vincent: [That too, was all grounded on the conjecture that you were a Stargazer. You, who continues to produce results unprecedented within the Kingdom, did things that could not be done by any ordinary person.]

Subaru: [That’s…]

Vincent: [Although, there was no need for me to go out of my way to worsen your impression of me. Even without acting, you are the type of person who would detest me the most. Abhorrence and disdain, they both overflow from your heart.]

Subaru: [YOU! DAMN! BASTARD…!]

Whether it was a lie, the truth, good, or bad, Abel’s words caused veins to pop in Subaru’s forehead.

But, as Subaru explored his relationship with Abel while treading on thin ice, Abel had come into contact with Subaru with a mental state akin to treading a tightrope. 

With Subaru on ice, and Abel walking a tightrope, such an interaction could not proceed smoothly.

After all, without looking down at their own feet, they had not looked at each other's faces either.

Subaru: [...I, don’t know anything about that Chisha person. He drove you off the throne, and turned himself into you pretending to be Emperor. I only happened upon him in Chaosflame when he was the Emperor.]

Vincent: [――――]

Subaru: [I don’t get what that person was thinking, or what he was scheming when he drove you away from the castle. But, you got frustrated over that person’s death in such a way, and he really died in place of you when you were supposed to die, that’s what I do get. That’s why…]

Falteringly, Subaru spoke of what he thought as he thought it. 

Since they had an unspoken agreement not to face each other, Subaru could not see Abel’s expression as he spoke those words. That was a bit frightening.

It was someone whom Abel lamented losing to the extent that he could not preserve the equilibrium of his heart. 

For Subaru to speak about that person while knowing nothing, he thought it may be a statement that excessively stomped on Abel’s heart.

But, he thought.

Subaru, though not for a very long time, had been caught up in circumstances concerning the destiny of a whole country, utterly manipulated by this man who introduced himself as Abel; that very Subaru thought. 

Subaru: [That Chisha person, he sure was incredible.]

Though it may have been inappropriate, he produced a spirited voice as he lifted his face.  

He did not try to forcefully make it cheerful, it had been praise that overflowed from Subaru’s heart.

In reality, how many of them were there? People who could betray the predictions of the man known as the wisest Emperor since the beginning of this Vollachian Empire, forming every last thing within his own mind, and deemed it acceptable when things proceeded as he had expected; how many people could go against that, and make a spectacle of their own goals? 

Just that was more than enough to earn Subaru’s praise.

Moreover, to the extent that Abel, who was left behind, would be hesitant and disheartened; though Subaru did not know if that was in accordance with the expectations.

Subaru: [You said whether you or that person was left behind, there wouldn’t be a big difference. If that’s true, then there’s only one reason why that person made this situation.]

Vincent: [...You.]

Subaru spoke as he thought, and without facing him, Abel spoke in a quiet voice.

He could not tell whether there was anger or not in the tone of that voice, and without verbally attacking Subaru in the way the latter had grown familiar with,

Vincent: [You, are you saying that you understand? The reason why Chisha plotted against me?]

Indeed, it was something to encourage Subaru to speak of the conclusion he had thought of. 

Vincent: [――――]

Abel desired the answer.

The answer that even his own, that even Abel’s own clever brain could not figure out. For something like that to come out of the mouth of Subaru, who did not even know the person known as Chisha, even if Abel had no expectations, he had begun to have expectations.

He couldn’t help but think of those expectations as added pressure, but,

Subaru: [Well, no matter what you’ll think of me, we’re already this far in…]

Once he took the offensive, there was no longer any reason to hesitate in speaking exactly what he thought. 

The reason why Chisha left not himself, but Abel, behind, that Subaru had thought of.

That was――,

Subaru: [When fate tried to kill you, and you resigned yourself to that opponent of fate, it must have irritated him.]

Vincent: [――Hah?]

Subaru: [There’s also a <u>pattern</u> where even if he himself died, he would have wanted you to live. But, I don’t think that’s the case here. After all, you don’t live in a way that would have anyone do such a thing for you.]

He could understand the feelings that one might want another person to live even if it meant they themselves would die. 

But, in order to have those feelings, they must greatly think of the other person as dear, and they need a reason to be made to think that way.

Gaining resolve for his own destined death, desperate to tread the grounds for the sake of those who would continue into the future, it was implausible that Abel would have anyone think of him in such a way.

Therefore, Subaru’s answer was that.

Subaru: [Chisha must have gotten irritated with you. After all, he even proved it.]

Vincent: [Proof, you say? What are… that I was plotted against, and that I was a fool?]

Subaru: [Flop-san and Mizelda-san have probably also realized that you're an intelligent moron. What I mean is… the reach of the thing known as fate.]

Vincent: [Fate…]

As though vocalizing that word for the first time, Abel rolled his tongue with the unfamiliar thing as he muttered.

In reality, for Abel, who confronted everything head on and continued to oppose with his own predictions, all impediments could be put into words, and he likely did not have the awareness to take on something so absurd and formless like “fate” as an opponent.

But, without a doubt, the enemy to which Abel had unconsciously accepted defeat was fate.

At the same time, Chisha had proved it by using his own life, and letting Abel live.

Subaru: [Fate can be fought. ――Something like a reason to give up, there isn’t even a single one.]

Vincent: [――――]

Faintly catching his breath, Abel kept silent as if the words he had been told had struck his very heart.

If he had not thought that his enemy was “fate”, he likely would have not thought to fight or resist it. It would not have been something he had even considered. 

However, supposing, if he were to know just who exactly that “enemy” was, what might happen?

The wisest Emperor since the beginning of the Vollachian Empire, if he knew the true identity of his “enemy”, just what would he do?

Subaru: [――Abel, I’m not a Stargazer.]

Vincent: [――――]

Subaru: [But――]

Next to the silent Abel, Subaru spoke as he placed his hands on the knees of his crossed legs.

When accused, he denied it, and was accused again. He denied it, was accused, and denied it again.

So long as he did not explain or verify the matter of his own Authority, the matter of Return by Death, Subaru had also set his heart on something during this dialogue. 

That would probably also have been his answer towards Todd Fang, whom he had been completely talked into a corner by, and unable to give a clear counterblow before they parted.

Subaru: [In the scope of my reach, I’ll save as many people as I can. Even still, truly, if there are even still lives that I can’t scoop up, that would be…]

Vincent: [...Would that not be, a defeat against fate?]

Subaru: [――. I can’t get a complete victory. After all, it’s not just me who's fighting fate.]

He had not been able to save everything.

Then even from here on, Subaru was unable to declare that he was going to save everything.

While roaring for that inevitable fate to bring it on, while vowing to continue fighting against fate, but still being faced with lives that were lost, Natsuki Subaru would mourn and lament, and then continue to say such things. 

Doing that, to diminish the chances for him to lament, and the chances for him to shed tears, for that purpose――.

Subaru: [Lend me your strength, Abel. If you do that, I’ll also lend you mine.]

Vincent: [――――]

Subaru: [From here on out, I’ll go all out on cooperation! …That said, I won't say selfish things without consulting with Emilia and the others, but that’s my enthusiasm. That’s why…]

Saying that, Subaru firmly clapped his knees, and stood up. 

Then, without looking at Abel’s face, he slowly advanced to the middle of the cabin, to the side of the bed. With a sidelong glance at the disheveled and bloodstained sheets, Subaru reached his hand into the fruit basket. 

Inside, there was the appa which Abel had cut in two and left alone. The white cross sections were turning to a light brown through contact with the air, but without concern for that, he picked them up.

Then――,

Subaru: [The appa that you cut in half, help me finish it.]

Tossing a halve of the appa over to Abel, he sunk his teeth into the halve he held onto.

With a nice sound, the sweet fruit juices slowly filled his mouth, and Subaru looked into Abel’s face as he sat down on the bed.

Having caught the thrown Appa, Abel looked down at it, and after a moment of hesitation, he bit into it.

With a similar nice sound, the sweet and sour flavor should have also filled his mouth.

Whether he liked it or disliked it, hated it or loved it, was completely unrelated to that flavor.
As fellow living beings, there was no difference in the flavor of the appa that they shared.

Vincent: [Natsuki Subaru.]

Subaru: [What?]

Vincent: [I am not fond of you.]

Subaru: [ngh]

Vincent: [――But, I require your strength.]

Declaring so, Abel slowly stood up. With the half-eaten appa in his hand, Abel fixed his black eyes upon Subaru.

Once again he hid all the emotional feelings that he had displayed in this cabin behind his consciousness as the Emperor, however, as those still slightly revealed themselves through his eyes and voice,

Vincent: [Apologies for the large amount of rudeness. Knight of the Kingdom.]

With that, upon seeing the Emperor of the Sacred Vollachian Empire bow his head, Subaru smiled.

Smiling, while biting into what remained of the appa,

Subaru: [I won’t apologize for my large amount of disrespect, Emperor of the Empire.]

With that, the first step was taken to rectify the discrepancies in their relationship, which had continued to be mistaken from the very start.
