*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*


???: [――Are you going to see him, Abel-san?]

Stopping at the call from his side, Vincent turned around.

The multiple carriages are connected together and treated as a single long dragon carriage, which allows the "Divine Protection" of the multiple earth dragons to be applied to it. ――Vincent closed one eye when he saw a familiar blue-haired girl standing at the juncture where he had crossed over.

Thinking back, it had been a long time since he had exchanged words with her in this way.

Vincent: [Have the uninvited guests from the kingdom achieved their purpose?]

Blue-haired girl: [Those people's purpose is not me, but…]

Vincent: [Cease. Do not take up my time with nonsense that even you do not fully believe. Time is precious. Especially under the current circumstances. As you understand.]

Blue-haired girl: [――――]

At the sound of Vincent's sharp voice, the girl lowered her head with eyes downcast.

However, she quickly raised her head, taking Vincent's sentiment that time is limited,

Blue-haired girl: [Are you going to see him, Abel-san?]

She repeated the same question again a second time.

Vincent: [I am not Abel. I am Vincent Vollachia.]

To that question, Vincent replied without changing his expression.

Abel was a temporary name, which he used only for his own convenience during his escape. He borrowed it from Abelux, his family name before he became emperor, and has no particular attachment to it.

But the displeasure of being called that was stronger now.

Vincent: [――. It has been reported that they are awake. I must confront them.]

Pushing aside his discomfort, Vincent answered the girl's question.

Whatever she thought, it would not change Vincent's decision. In fact, she did not even think that she had that intention or thought.

Protected, displaced, distressed, and coming to a natural conclusion over a long period of time.

Like many things, she is just an ordinary person.

Therefore, Vincent wanted to cut off the question and answer quickly.

However――,

Blue-haired girl: [He is not your enemy, Abel-san.]

"――なに？"
Vincent: [――What?]

Vincent furrowed his brow when he received an unexpected reply from the girl he had expected to be silent and downcast.

The girl who looked at Vincent with such a look, her pale blue eyes, had a certain purpose in them.

It was a light that did not dwell in them when they parted, and it penetrated Vincent timidly but boldly, as if it was trying to pin him down.

Vincent: [――. I am Vincent Vollachia. There shall not be a third time.]

Blue-haired girl: [I am sorry. But I do not remember, so I do not know much about His Excellency the Emperor Vincent. So there is nothing I can say to His Excellency the Emperor Vincent.]

Vincent: [――――]

Blue-haired girl: [He is not your enemy, Abel-san.]

The girl repeatedly emphasized so without once averting her gaze.

Vincent knew her by the abilities she possessed: she was the reins of control for Natsuki Subaru and a valuable healing magic user.

If they were aware of their position and took a strong stand against Vincent, it would be called bold, but this did not seem to be the case.

And then――,

Vincent: [You, what did you say your name was?]

Blue-haired girl:: [――Rem. At least that's definitively answered now.]

Vincent: [The girl who has no memories, making a declaration?]

Rem: [It's strange. Even if I don't remember it in my head or in my heart, sometimes the environment is able to inform me. I am Rem, thanks to someone who kept telling me that I was Rem.]

Whether it was gratitude or astonishment, the girl ――Rem herself did not have an understanding of what she was talking about.

However, Vincent concluded that there was no need for further conversation, knowing only that it did not lead to disgust or loathsome negative thoughts.

He turned around and proceeded to walk away. On the way,

Vincent: [Rem, never again let my time be so needlessly squandered. At the next act of disrespect, I shall cut off your head.]

With that, he ended his conversation with Rem.

And then――,

Vincent: : [How eloquent shall your words be, Natsuki Subaru?  ――O Stargazer of the Dragon Kingdom.]

△▼△▼△▼△

While acutely sensing the hostility being directed towards him, Subaru confronted the man.

In retrospect, his relationship with this man could be summed up with the word “incomprehensible”.

At their first meeting, he had been a suspicious masked man camping out in a forest. In that occasion, he had been frantically searching for Rem and Louis, whom he had lost sight of; hence why he had not probed deeper into that matter, deeming him as nothing more than someone fishy.

The next time they met, it had occurred inside a cage in the Shudraq village; Subaru could hardly explain why the man had acted so self-important despite his status as a prisoner. He would rather that there had been some means of escape, because after that he was made to take part in the Lifeblood Ritual, in which he had acted irrationally.

Thereafter, his help in retrieving Rem notwithstanding, he had come to part with Subaru on one occasion, however, he had known that Subaru's group would have no option but to return. Not informing them of those circumstances had been a show of his underhandedness.

Immediately after, he had fully cooperated with Subaru's plan to capture the Fortress City of Guaral; the dancers that went by Natsumi Schwartz, Bianca, and Fiora thus entered the enemy's stronghold together.

There were doubts regarding his unusual relationship with Priscilla, and after, in the Demon City, he was courted by Yorna, and after, he declared that Louis should not be allowed to live, and after, they parted ways.

And even then, once Subaru had escaped from the Gladiator Island, and once he heard of the situation enveloping the Empire at large, he'd held full conviction that said situation had been instigated by the man, the Emperor who had been ousted from his throne.

Surrendering the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, he took command of the great number of people retreating, of the great number of people evacuating the Imperial Capital, and once more the Emperor widely-renowned as wise directed the people of the Empire as the one at their apex――.

Subaru: [It's an honor to have Vincent Vollachia-san come and visit me. You arrived at just the right time, can you peel me an appa?]

Vincent: [Do not play games with me. In the first place, I am not able to peel a fruit. Where are the appas, even?]

Subaru: [Where are…?]

At the question of the man who had set foot into the bedroom, approaching him, Subaru's gaze turned to the side.

Even in another world it was standard practice for fruit to be brought when visiting someone injured or ill; it was perhaps a bit of a cliché in situations of the sort. For that reason, there was a basket of appas next to his bed.

Naturally, his conversational partner should be able to see it as well.

Subaru: [In that basket of fruits there. The red ones, don’t they look delicious or what?]

Vincent: [Fool, are you duping me? Appas are fruits of white color.]

Subaru: [Well, they’re white inside once you’ve peeled them, but… Wait, this conversation, I think I recall having this very exchange, stored way, way back in the recesses of my memories.]

Memories of it were rather faint, but he had the feeling he’d had that conversation quite some time prior.

The details of whom he had been talking to at the time could not be recalled, but he did have the memory of getting the same impression he was getting now, that those of nobility had reached an extreme to this point.

Either way――,

Subaru: [I guess there are things you don't know either. How unexpected.]

With that not-at-all-tense preface to their first mutual exchange of words in a while, feeling like they had not started off badly, Subaru stated so.

At Subaru's words, the man―― Abel, extended a hand to the basket, and split the appa in half with the knife left there. Naturally, a cross-section of its white insides was exposed.

Subaru: [――――]

Laying eyes upon that undeniable result, did he have the mind to admit what was actually factual in their previous exchange? Abel put down the knife, and, leaving the fruit split in half in the basket, turned to Subaru.

Moisterning those sable eyes of his still, was unmistakable hostility.

Subaru: [No way, you're mad at me for embarrassing you about what color’s an appa…? You’re the one who’s called me something weird just now.]

Vincent: [Stargazer of the Dragon Kingdom, it was.]

Subaru: [Right.]

One more time being made aware of how he had been referred to, Subaru frowned, as he had no idea what was he on about.

That term was not one he had no recollection of. If he were not mistaken, from what he had heard, it was something like a term that referred to the diviners that accompanied the Emperor closely, in the Empire.

Very much like the Dragon History Stone, the Kingdom of Lugunica’s tablet of prophecies, they were an existence that spoke of the future.

Subaru: [No, feels like you spoke of it in a way even worse than that… You put it like it’s like peeping into the near future.]

Vincent: [I recognize it as such, without a doubt. That is how I perceive those things.]

Subaru: [If that’s the case, you spoke of me as if I’m a peeping tom just now, are you aware of that?]

If the world had not changed, then by normal standards he’d have the right to cut Vincent down for insulting him, no? Or, to put it into modern terms, Subaru was aware of, he was preprared to fight for defamation of character in a civil court.

However, faced with Subaru’s reply, Abel's countenance did not waver in the slightest. Those black eyes of his, the same color as Subaru’s own but with different depths to them, told Subaru that he had no intent to play along.

Of course, Subaru did not intend to mess about either――,

Vincent: [How much do you know?]

Subaru: [How much do I know, about the current situation? If that’s what you mean, I wasn’t told many of the details. Emilia and everyone else was worried right after I woke up… But I know we’re in the middle of retreating.]

Vincent: [――――]

Subaru: [The civil war has stopped for the time being, everyone’s fleeing from the Imperial Capital right now… Seems like it was hella chaotic, but it doesn’t feel like it’s a complete mess.]

The dragon carriage moved unceasingly, the night view outside the window shifting at a slow pace, but with the Divine Protection of Wind Evasion shielding it from the vibration and the howling of the wind, it all was quiet.

One would think that the very quietude in the passenger cars of the dragon carriage as quite loud, but that the dragon carriage had not halted its march even once was evidence that no major troubles had popped up.

And that was in spite of the fact that a considerable number of people, most likely in the hundreds of thousands, were supposedly on the move.

Subaru: [The Nine Divine Generals and whatnot probably had some pull, but that alone wouldn’t enough. As I thought, you’re the real deal, man.]

Vincent: [――――]

Subaru: [Honestly, when I heard the story of you being betrayed by your right-hand man and retainer, being ousted from the throne, I thought real good if it’d be fine to have you back as Emperor, but, it turned out to be the right option.]

Leadership and charisma, were the so-called qualities of those standing above others.

These qualities were not simply the result of outstanding ability, they could be acquired through blood, sweat and tears, but there were only a scant few born with these traits as well.

The royals of each country, the heads of many an organization, were such cases.

In that sense, Abel, who’d had something to fall back on in times of emergency, still held the potential to be followed, to be looked up to by those around him.

Subaru: [It annoys me that rather than being on the fence about it, I was leaning more towards believing it. But my decision was right, you are the Emperor…]

Vincent: [――Is that as per your expectations as well?]

Subaru: [Huh?]

A quiet voice, however it had certainly been laced with emotion. Exactly because it seemed way out of left field, Subaru’s brain refused to comprehend it.

As a result, Subaru did not dodge the hand that thus was extended, his forehead being pushed down onto the bed, alongside his body. And before he could raise an objection as to what the hell was going on, he perceived the sensation of something sharp against his throat.

Which he immediately realized to be the tip of the paring knife with which the appa had just been split.

He had made that realization, yet he knew not the intent behind it. He knew not the meaning of Abel clasping that knife, and turning it towards Subaru in that manner, directing his hostility at him―― Nay, directing his hatred, the same hatred his voice was rife in.

Subaru: [――――]

From near proximity, within breathing distance of one another, Subaru and Abel shared mutual glares.

If Subaru were to carelessly raise his voice in a call for help at this juncture, Abel would not hesitate in slitting Subaru's throat with the knife.

But conversely, Abel was not doing so at once was because he had no reason to.

Subaru: [What, are you doing… Hk.]

Vincent: [That ought to be mine question, what are your plans? Just how far in advance have you seen the current events unfolding? Is everything up to this point exactly as you have envisioned?]

Subaru: [I’ve told you already…! I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. What am I scheming…?]

Vincent: [――Why, did you leave me behind, and not Chisha?]

In comparison to the blade at his throat, the tone of his voice was by far and away more penetrating. It silenced Subaru, and Abel’s hand shook, trembled while gripping the knife.

As Abel gritted his teeth, as he glowered at Subaru from point-blank range, the former had asserted so.

And that, was not something Subaru was able to comprehend immediately.

Subaru: [Abel…]

Vincent: [It's Vincent Vollachia.]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [I, am no Abel. I am none other than the Seventy-Seventh Emperor of the Vollachian Empire, Vincent Vollachia. ――That, is what you have desired, is it not?]

Declaring such as if he were wringing the words out of himself, Abel―― Nay, Vincent, gave his name with a hint of disgust.

Not quite understanding the meaning of that attitude of his, an attitude as if he were cursing himself for giving his name as such, Subaru knitted his brows. Because, of course he would.

Subaru: [You… went to war so you could reclaim that name, and that crown, wasn’t it…?]

Vincent: [Incorrect. I was striving to fulfill my duty as Emperor. The Covenant with the People of Shudraq, the fall of the fortified city, the negotiations with Yorna Mishigure, and the provocation of civil war were all for that purpose.]

Subaru: [Your duty as Emperor…?]

Vincent: [While on the throne, Vincent Vollachia is killed. With that as the starting point, the Great Disaster will attempt to destroy the Empire, the means to oppose which being left behind by Vincent Vollachia. That, is my duty.]

Subaru: [Haa…]

As Vincent enumerated the particulars of his scheme to him for the first time, Subaru exhaled a hoarse breath.

That expression, “Great Disaster”, was one unfamiliar to Subaru’s ears, but what astonished Subaru even more than that was the very way Vincent had recited it all.

Per his words, with the murder of Vincent Vollachia, the Great Disaster would commence.

And after, he had also stated that he would leave behind the means with which to oppose the Great Disaster.

Rather than searching for those means, he would leave them behind.

From how he had spoken, it was as if――.

Subaru: [The way you spoke… It’s kinda like you knew you were going to die…]

While firmly sensing the cold tip of clear-cup death trained on the nape of his neck, Subaru muttered.

With Death perhaps creeping closer to Subaru, before him, Vincent’s sable eyes wavered with uncertainty. The unknown expanse that laid beyond their jet-black coloration, he had a hunch on its true identity.

‘Twas resignation, adorned with the will to resist.

Vincent: [Indeed. I have made mine demise a part of my plans. I left behind plans to ensure that the Vollachian Empire would not fall to ruin, even with mine passing.]

And thus, none other than Vincent himself Vincent himself confirmed his intuition as correct; the very next instant, Subaru started seeing red, his emotions exploding.

Subaru: [YOU BASTARD, ARE YOU GODDAMN SCREWING AROUND!?]

Teeth bared and eyes flaring up in anger, Subaru gave Vincent―― No, the cowardly bastard before him the death stare, bellowing. There was a flash of acute pain at his neck, but that would be postponed until much, much later.

Right here and now, it was much more important to just beat the living shit out of this wimp wearing a self-satisfied face.

Subaru: [After swinging so many people around, after making them cross so many dangerous bridges, after making them take so many unnecessary detours with you, you planned to die at the end of it all? You’ve got to be screwing around!]

Vincent: [As if I would do anything such as jest. Everything you have spoken of was done because it was the road that needed to be taken. At its terminus was to be my death, a matter the importance of which cannot possibly be compared to the fate of the Empire hanging in the balance.]

Subaru: [That’s not it! What I'm saying is, why are you the first to resign yourself and your own life? Some big disaster? Don’t know anything about it! Why don't you just stay alive and face it yourself!?]

Vincent: [Do you lot not know any better but to chatter nonsense. While I live, the Great Disaster shan’t come. That is the premise of this plan. It cannot be prevented from happening――]

Subaru: [Who decided it can't be prevented? You're a smart guy, so you just need to do anything you can trick your way out of the Great Disaster happening…]

Vincent: [――It was you Stargazers who informed me that it could never be prevented!]

Vincent, stifling his emotions, had been replying to a Subaru prattling on and on with sentimentality. But the former’s feelings had now exploded in front of Subaru's eyes.

Just how unexpected had that violent outburst been, coming from Vincent. Had Subaru not seized the blade of the knife with his opposite hand himself, who knew where the tip of the knife would have stabbed, such had been the torrent of emotions.

In drips, blood trickled from Vincent’s left hand grabbing the pointed end of the knife, staining the white sheets here and there.

However, neither Subaru nor Vincent paid any mind to the falling droplets of blood, instead focusing their attention to each other’s eyes, to the other’s being beyond said eyes.

Yet again, Vincent had dubbed Subaru a Stargazer.

Therein laid the reason as to why Vincent Vollachia hated, harbored hostility towards Natsuki Subaru, even going as far as to train a knife at him.

It was precisely because he happened to understand it, that his questions were unanswerable.

Subaru: [The Stargazers… informed you…]

Vincent: [――. The Stargazers hear the voices of the Observers from the heavens above, that exist beyond. They speak of events that may occur in the far future, conferring us with the possibility of minimizing the damage. But, they speak only of the scale of the damage. Not of how to prevent it from happening beforehand.]

In a disgusted voice, yet one attempting to stifle any emotions as much as possible, Vincent commenced speaking.

Subaru was reminded of one thing from amidst the contents of his speech. If the Stargazers were truly able to foretell the future, from his experience, actually being able to change it would be no easy feat.

The power of destiny, that which likely could be called the natural passage of time, would stick to a predetermined path as much as possible; avoiding impending tragedies and avoidance of impending tragedy would bring those who challenged it to their knees.

The Stargazers' precognitions, were akin to what Subaru knew from experience.

For example, were Subaru to Return by Death due to a natural catastrophe, he could urge everyone to take refuge in preparation, but he would be unable to stop the natural catastrophe itself.

Whether that would prevent the destruction of houses and buildings, or even prevent the loss of human lives entirely, he did not know until he had a go at it, but he held no doubts that that would be difficult.

Vincent: [Many times in the past, the Stargazers have precluded correctly that perils would befall the Empire. Those crisis were dealt with to the extent possible, but some things cannot be saved. There, plans are necessary.]

Subaru: [Plans…]

Vincent: [Plans with which to keep the damage at a minimum, and lessen those lost to as close to zero as possible.]

――Calamities awaited in the future, doings were done so that a greater number of people would be able to overcome them. Doings were done so that a great number of people would not be left behind.

For the sake of making that come to pass, Vincent Vollachia would have toiled, sparing no effort.

Vincent: [It was you, Stargazers, who whispered of mine death. How dare you, with that mouth, utter that my death must be defied? Are you toying with me… with me!?] [1]

Translation notes:
[1] Now as the Emperor, Vincent retakes his use of “余” as a pronoun, as seen in Arc 7 Chapter 107. However here, his mask as an Emperor crumbles, and returns to using “俺” as a pronoun, much like he did before ascending to the seat of Emperor, and after getting ousted, which is noted here with italics (further uses will also be noted in the same fashion). This is to symbolize his complete lost of composure and behavior as Emperor.

Subaru: [W-wait, wait a sec! You’ve been on about me being a Stargazer for a while now but…]

Vincent: [――You see things that have yet to happen. Cease your plots, Natsuki Subaru.]

With those scant words, Subaru tasted the feeling of having his heart, within his chest, made to stop.

In the process of spewing out the recesses of his very own heart, the mask of Emperor fell away, and visible on the other side was not the face of Vincent Vollachia, but rather the face of a man rife with defects who went by the name of Abel.

And finally, once the man looked at him directly, once the man declared those words, Subaru finally comprehended.

Subaru: [――Ah.]

Vincent ―― No, Abel, had dubbed him a Stargazer, and Subaru had understood the reason for that.

Abel, had perceived Subaru's Return by Death.

In precise terms, he had not perceived Subaru's Return by Death, he had perceived that via the loss of his life Subaru had gone back in time, thus bringing back information from the future―― he had perceived that Subaru held the means to know what laid ahead.

And it was finally then that he comprehended that this was akin to the foresight abilities Abel knew to be held by Stargazers.

Subaru: [――――]

If he gave it some thought, it was quite natural that a mistake like this would possibly occur.

Of course it would. Subaru himself had found in Abel's exposition about the Stargazers something in common with his own Return by Death, in his pursuit for understanding and appeasement.

Armed with the knowledge of the precedent represented by the Stargazers, if Subaru were to attain results beyond the capabilities he was possessed of, it was no surprise that he would draw a connection―― No, that he would identify him as such.

Abel's insight was a reliable one. His acumen would certainly scrutinize all things.

With that insight of his, he had immediately grasped that Subaru had not survived all the situations he had come across in the Empire through his pauper abilities and sheer fortune.

Therefore, therefore it was certain that.

Subaru: [So that's why you always wanted my opinion?]

With Subaru’s future sight, he would interpret his opinion as the proposal that came as the result of selecting the optimal move; and no matter just how idiotic the former’s proposal did sound to the ears, Abel would be unable to discard it that bluntly.

The refusal in allowing the Shudraq village to go up in flames, the crossdressing performed with the purpose of capturing the Fortress City, the travel to the Demon City of Chaosflame, the negotiations with Yorna, in all of those.

In every single one of those, Abel had explored the possibility of actualizing Subaru’s proposals, earnestly scrutinizing them.

In this manner, Abel had attempted to drag Subaru, who was possibly a Stargazer, into the struggle for the Empire's survival, employing him as a pawn in a game. ――After he himself was lost, Subaru would be one of the means of resistance.

Despite this――,

Vincent: […You, left me behind, not Chisha.]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [Natsuki Subaru, you are a banal human being.]

It came in a form different from the one just prior, the timbre of that voice was vanished of sentiment.

There was no attempt to repress emotions. If there indeed was such an attempt, those very real emotions would eek out, able to be heard in their try to appeal outwards.

Yet nothing was heard. They were not being repressed, those emotions were dead.

And with that tone of voice killed of emotions, Abel let loose words bereft of hue towards Subaru.

Vincent: [A naïve, green, immature human being, holding on to plenty of bitterness. Neither do you possess virtue worthy of mention, nor do you possess viciousness worthy of mention. Had you gone without accomplishing anything, you would have died an ordinary man.]

Subaru's characterization, spoken so matter-of-factly, left absolutely no room for retort.

As per Abel’s pertinent judgement, Subaru was unable to become anyone special. Even having given himself into the lack of maturity of his body and mind, even with his spirit being able to return to the days he had believed himself to be a child prodigy, he also knew what he would eventually be in the future to come, an unfinished human being.

But――,

Vincent: [You have been bestowed with an opportunity to surpass banal, ordinary men. By making perfect use of it, you have survived till this day. You have not been banal, you have not been an ordinary person, you have no strong disposition toward either virtue or viciousness.]

Subaru: [Abel…]

Vincent: [You… are a banal human being… If so, why?]

Suddenly, potently, Abel gritted his teeth, looking at Subaru.

He cast away his expression, his nobleness and his graciousness, his composure and his self-confidence and everything entirely, baring the true face visible on the other side of the mask of Emperor that had been stripped away, his voice quivering

And with that quivering voice as it was, with that trembling voice as it was, he exclaimed.

Vincent: [Why, did you leave me behind, Natsuki Subaru!]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [You have no bond to this Empire, nor any obligations. You could have been content with protecting the many people you have come to know till this day, and nothing more. Why did you save me? Why did you think of saving me, a man who is not at all compatible with you…!]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [Why…?]

His extreme emotions, his hoarse voice conveyed just how monumental was Abel’s desire to pose that inquiry, “Why?”.

With more and more strength he grasped the blade of the knife, digging even deeper into his hand; more and more intense grew the flow of blood, so painful to gaze at as to cause Subaru to instantaneously release the knife and attempt to staunch the hemorrhage.

However――,

Vincent: [Do not touch me!]

Subaru: [Agh!]

His hand was violently swatted away, and instantaneously becoming aware of pain in the hand he had outstretched, Subaru produced a grimace.

Upon taking a look, Subaru saw that the knife within the hand of that strikingly-different Abel had slashed his own hand, drip-by-drip blood trickling from it.as well..

In the space between the two confronting one another, the sheets became increasingly sullied by their blood, blood that went on dripping away without efforts to stop it.

And thus, in that manner, paying no heed to their blood flowing out of him, to the soiled sheets, to the soiled floor and the soiled sheets and floor,

Vincent: […Just now, you reached out your hand. That is what is most baffling, and what is most incompatible with me, in your way of being.]

Subaru: [――――]

Vincent: [Every so often you leave it all to the emotions you feel at the moment, punting to the wayside all beliefs and ideas you have felt until then. You do not follow what you have decided upon, easily reversing whatever course you have concluded you ought to be taking. You are unable to categorize what ought be saved or not, reaching out your hand indiscriminately."

Subaru: [――Ah.]

His blood oozing out, faced with the glaring Abel’s insight and words, Subaru was robbed of his breath.

Even the pain of the wound, the origin of the blood, grew distant, with Subaru’s thoughts freezing over. Because what Abel had stated just now, held the exact same meaning as what had tormented Subaru in a recent occasion.

Todd: [――But you were willing to choose whether to save Katya or not, right?]

Subaru: [――――]

Before he had lost his consciousness to which he had returned just prior, those had been the words hurled towards him.

Deciding himself and Natsuki Subaru to be incompatible in every sense possible, determining Natsuki Subaru to be a monster he could never understand, at what seemed to be the ultimate parting forced upon them, Todd Fang had trained a blade of words towards the former.

He did not draw that conclusion on Subaru due to Return by Death or due to a status as a Stargazer, as well; perhaps it had been his power of observation, honed through his life as a werewolf, that had seen through Subaru's peculiarities, defining the latter as he had.

Todd: [You’re too damn inconsistent! Your eyes say that you’re willing to die at any moment, you’re willing to put other people’s lives on a scale selfishly, but when it comes to this, you’re desperate to resist. It’s creepy!]

Subaru: [――Hk.]

Todd’s chilly gaze, his voice devoid of heat, overlapped with those of Abel before him.

Abel’s gaze, Abel’s voice possessed the fervor of rage, nonetheless the two still overlapped. The reason for that, undoubtedly, was that both were attempting to part with Subaru.

A preface for ousting Natsuki Subaru, rejecting that whose way of being was incompatible with theirs, from their world.

Todd: [Lack of self-awareness is a bad trait. You’re choosing between life and death. Who to save, who to let die, you decide freely. I’ll show favor towards those who butter up to me, but I don’t care about those who don’t. Me, I won’t hesitate to butter anyone up, but…]

Todd: [How can I have a relationship with someone who decides who lives or dies based on his own fickle whims?]

Thus, what had driven Todd to commit the heinous acts he had committed, had been Subaru’s way of thinking, his behavior, as per his words.

Of course, Subaru had not just eaten it all up entirely, he did not consider himself to be at fault. He had done what he thought to be correct, in his own Subaru way. But were he to simply change his ways, Subaru would be unable to show his face to the companions who had followed him, placed their faith in him till this day.

At the same time however, there was a truth he could not repudiate completely.

――Subaru was choosing who to let live and who to let die, as he had indeed stated.

Through the Authority of Return by Death, Subaru had transfigured the fates of those precious to him.

Those that could do nothing but lose their lives, that could do nothing but hurt one another, that could do nothing but struggle for those dear to them, that could do nothing but deprive themselves of the opportunity to understand others. He had distorted their fates, keeping them alive.

Through the decisions and actions Subaru had taken, assuredly, the number of people around Subaru who had been robbed of their lives or become unhappy had diminished.

However, Natsuki Subaru had not been capable of saving every single person, either.

Whether he had not saved them, whether he had been unable to save them, the fact that he had decided, of his own will, to proceed without going back in time, not considering what laid ahead or to his back, remained unshakable.

He had not destroyed all of his “enemies”.

But, he had not saved all of his “enemies”. Just how had Subaru come to discern which to save, and which not to save?

That that was possibly due to Subaru’s personal likes and dislikes, was Todd’s fear.

Vincent: [No, that is not so, Natsuki Subaru. It is not even up to what people you like and what people you dislike.]

Subaru: […Huh?]

Abel’s words restrained Subary from shaking his head, the latter having been made aware of the unbridgeable gap between himself and Todd once more.

With Subaru holding his breath and raising his face, Abel so relayed.

Vincent: [Were you to determine who to save and who not to save based on your subjective preferences of people’s characters, that I would be able to understand. But, you save even those you loathe. Such as me.]

Subaru: [Nothing…]

Of the sort, so he wished to assert, yet Subaru’s words did not continue.

Whether Subaru hated Abel enough to abandon him at the eleventh hour was something he would only understand were he to do some deep introspection, but the truth was, that he had reached out his hand to someone he loathed.

But to no avail. In spite of that, Subaru had attempted to reach out to Todd as well.

At the very end of it all, he had not let go. Their conflict notwithstanding, Louis had remained alongside Subaru till this day.

If he were told to reach out to someone he loathed as well, he would do exactly that.

Vincent: [――Take your people from the Kingdom, and leave Vollachia.]

As Subaru reflected upon his prior deeds, aghast, those unforeseen words struck him.

Slowly raising his eyes, he came to lay them upon Abel, who had returned the knife his hand had held to the basket of fruits, that wrathful hue erased from his countenance, weaving words in tandem with what had been his facial expression until then.

He, towards a Subaru astonished at the change in demeanor and at the content of the words thrown at him, resumed.

Vincent: [From this point onwards, the Empire shall be plunged into battle against the Great Disaster. The board is different from the one I was attempting to arrange, but alas, a way through remains. You are not required here."

Subaru: [Wha…]

Vincent: [I have heard enough nonsense. Whatever your intentions may be, what you have already done must be considered definite. Questioning the merits of your reasoning for that, is the pinnacle of futility.]

Those were not so much words directed towards Subaru, as they were words directed towards his own self.

With this, Abel was about to unilaterally terminate the emotional exchange with Subaru, the exchange in which he had bared all his emotions, the exchange that had encompassed of them.

It had not been merely a behavior far too unusual for him.

A topic mentioned in the emotional and emotionally dead moments both, the name “Chisha” was one Subaru happened to know of.

Judging from how he had voiced it all, Chisha had apparently lost his life amidst the siege of the Imperial Capital, and therein supposedly laid the true motives for Abel’s inquiries on why had had been saved.

Attempting to cover up what he truly was thinking, Abel would try to pretend that that had never, ever truly happened.

Vincent: [Make preparations to return to your country. Make all the necessary arrangements to cross the border. Everything apart from that is the Empire's problem―― my problem.]

Thus, changing his way of referring to himself, and restraining all his conduct as Abel, were expressions of the resolution he had arrived at, to move forth as Emperor Vincent Vollachia.

And just how meaningful, just how heavy were the things he had been entrusted with, and the reasons for that decision, were all things Subaru could not possibly understand.

Natsuki Subaru could not understand Vincent Vollachia.

Vincent Vollachia could not understand Natsuki Subaru as well.

And with that, that fruitless moment was coming to an end, with naught more than both shedding the others’ blood――.

Todd: [You’re a monster. Much more so than that zombie.]

Them being unable to understand him, them having something unbridgeable in-between them and him, their parting being inevitable. They both had reached that conclusion all on their own, they both had decided so all on their own, they both had ended things all on their own.

Didn’t you regret that it had to end the way it did, you goddamn idiot.

Subaru: [Hey, Abel.]

Turning his back, his conduct indicating that the conversation had drawn to a close, the Emperor advanced towards the door. Turning away, the emperor, who had indicated that the conversation was over, proceeded to the door. The slender back making its departure was called out to, and the Emperor, taking a calm, short breath, halted his steps.

And as he was, the Emperor, with eyes devoid of heat, turned his countenance over his shoulder, and spoke,

Vincent: [Do understand. I am Vincent Vollachia, a man that goes by Abel, or anything of the sort――]

Subaru: [――Shut the hell up. Let’s see you grit those teeth!]

Making use of the bouncy springs of the bed and blasting off, Subaru at last charged towards that face.

At that profile, the profile of one deciding to end things all on his own, the pompous profile of one daring to leave all on his own after saying only that much, that odious profile of one taking absolutely everything and anything upon himself; either way, already unevitably irritated, pissed off, Subaru drove his small, blood-soaked fist into that profile. Something he had always really wanted to do.
