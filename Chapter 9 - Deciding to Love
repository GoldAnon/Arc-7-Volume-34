*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Withdrawal from the Imperial Capital Lupugana.

Although it was judged to be a necessary decision, it was still a major incident in the history of the Empire.

The Imperial Capital, which was under the Emperor's direct supervision, not only allowed the “enemy” to advance to the Crystal Palace, but the Emperor was even forced to abandon both the castle and the city and flee. The decline of his authority is unavoidable.

However――,

Goz: [Given that we do not know the intentions of those ominous guys, Your Excellency's judgment would be the best course of action.]

Olbart: [Kakakakka! Ain't an Emperor abandonin' the Palace ta flee unheard of? At the very least, I've never heard anythin' like that 'til this age]

Goz: [Do not laugh, General First-Class Olbart! If you think about His Excellency's feelings… If you think about it, I! Damn! Without fail, under His Excellency's command, we will recapture the castle and the Imperial Capital!!]

Ubilk: [Waawaaaa~, are we running away? Your judgment is quiiite~ fast! As for me, I’m not into the mindset of fighting to the last breath, so I think that's the right decision to take.]

At that moment, there was no one who opposed Vincent's decision.

This was because Vincent had assigned positions based on practical abilities rather than loyalty, which proved to be worthwhile. Although rebellion was also incited due to differences in opinions, ultimately, his closest and most trusted ally had betrayed him. Therefore, any differences in loyalty were merely a margin of error.

In any case, it was time to begin the retreat.

Vincent: [Olbart Dunkelkenn, buy us some time. If left alone, Moguro Hagane will be defeated quickly. We cannot let the reservoir be destroyed yet.]

Olbart: [Geez, it's not good ta overwork the elderly. How ‘bout usin' Goz instead?]

Vincent: [Agility and swiftness are the specialties of a shinobi. Fulfill your duty without indecision.]

Olbart: [...Just warnin' ya, even I can't catch him if he focuses on flyin', y'know?]

Above, Balleroy Temeglyph, who had died, cut through the sky of the Imperial Capital as he flew. After listening to Olbart, who implicitly said that he still had his skills from when he was still alive as the greatest dragon rider from the Vollachian Empire, thus conveying the toughness of their opponent, Vincent, even so, entrusted the task to the monstrous old man.

As Olbart said, while there may have been some differences in aptitude, Goz could still fulfill the same role.

However, when speaking of differences in aptitude, there was a role that Goz must fulfill. This loud and overbearing General was exceptionally trusted by his troops.

Therefore,

Vincent: [Goz Ralfon, make use of your absurd volume. From now on, what we need to retreat from the Imperial Capital is manpower. Gather any scattered troops in the vicinity.]

Goz: [Yes! Leave it to me, Your Excellency! Right away!!]

Without hesitation, Goz nodded and jumped onto a nearby pile of rubble with his bare upper body. There, he took a deep breath and shouted to the world where the thunderous noise of the titanic Moguro's battle echoed.

His incredibly loud voice raised objections to the shaking air of the Imperial Capital.

Goz: [Listen up, Sword Wolves of Vollachia!! These are orders from the top of the Sword Wolves, his Excellency Vincent Vollachia! Follow my voice! Follow it!!]

When Goz's directive was issued, with loudness that sounded like the roar of a magic stone cannon firing, Vincent covered his ears and looked towards Olbart as if testing him. Olbart, who was also covering his ears, shook his head slowly and said,

Olbart: [I can't do something like that. So you’re just choosing the right person for the task, right?]

Leaving only those words behind, Olbart's figure disappeared into the sky, leaving a trail behind him.

The monstrous old man climbed the cracked walls of the Crystal Palace left by the aftermath of the battle, using them as footholds. Halfway, he jumped onto the massive body of Moguro and intervened in the battlefield where the Cloud Dragon and the Magical Sharpshooter were cooperating. The Vicious Old Man demonstrated his power and began to manipulate the situation.

Olbart might have said something about being unable to keep up with his flying opponent, but, with his shinobi's gear and his hidden techniques, he most likely had countless ways to deal with the situation.

If the monstrous old man joined the battle, Moguro's disadvantage would likely be somewhat overturned.

Ubilk: [Your Excellency, is there anything you want uuus~ to do?]

Vincent: [――. How many of you Stargazers are there in the surroundings?]

As Goz was gathering the people, Vicent asked Ubilk, who had nothing else to do. Ubilk responded to Vincent's question with a "Weeell~" and placed the fingers of both of his hands on his cheeks.

Ubilk: [Let's see, within the range where our voices can be heard, there are twenty-seven of uuus~.]

Vincent: [More than I expected. Then, go around opening doors in the residences one by one. Tell them that the Emperor and the troops will abandon the Capital so, even if they remain in the city, they will only be throwing away their lives.]

Ubilk: [Understood! This is it, this is it! An all-out war…… The united effort of the entire Vollachian Empire to resist the Great Disaster, this is what I've wanted to do.]

Vincent: [Quickly, get it done.]

Vincent let out a sigh as he drove away the excited Ubilk, who could not contain his excitement over being able to achieve his goal as a member of the Stargazers.

Vincent then looked at Berstetz, who remained silent so as not to disturb his thoughts and deliberations.

He was the individual who joined Chisha Gold, the ringleader of the civil war, and caused chaos in the Empire by driving Vincent from the throne.

Vincent: [You are being very quiet.]

Berstetz: [In the present situation, two heads giving commands can only sow seeds of confusion. If a Sword Wolf were to be born with two heads, it would mean…]

Vincent: [One of the two necks must be severed as your duty?]

Berstetz: [If you desired it, it would be a pleasure for this old man to offer you his neck.]

With his hands clasped behind his back, Berstetz calmly stated his resolve.

Although he was far from a man of military prowess, within him burned the pride of an Imperial man. Vincent did not believe that Berstetz had rebelled out of a lust for power, nor did he believe that the words he had just uttered were a perfunctory evasion.

Plain and simple, a devout devotion to the Empire was Berstetz's driving force.

For that reason, when he saw a threat to the Empire, he would immediately drop his previous policies and plans, and would not hesitate to stand on the same side as Vincent.

Vincent: [When Goz Ralfon, the Stargazer, and the others finish their preparations, we will begin our withdrawal immediately. Berstetz, you may offer your opinion on this. Do not take long.]

Berstetz: [――With all due respect, Your Excellency, if you are going to withdraw, please follow your own thoughts.]

Vincent: [――――]

To Vincent, who had asked for a concise opinion, Berstetz responded.

Although his words were enigmatic, Berstetz did not mean to mislead Vincent. After a moment of contemplation, Vincent understood the meaning of those words.

To follow one's own thoughts, that was to say, the thoughts of Vincent Vollachia.

――That was the same mindset that Chisha Gold had been following up until now.

Berstetz: [General Chisha’s prediction of living in your place, if he had helped me usurp the throne…]

Vincent: [――He must have guessed what the Great Disaster would consist of, and had prepared for it.]

Berstetz: [It is as you say. And it is something that only Your Excellency the Emperor could notice, and anyone other than Your Excellency the Emperor would not notice.]

As Berstetz spoke, with one eye closed, Vincent contemplated.

The opinion expressed by the Prime Minister was understandable. ――No, it was reasonable. Even without Berstetz’s advice, Vincent would have come to the same conclusion, but this gained time.

Chisha staked his life to remain in the form of Vincent on the throne. And what if he had left Vincent with more than just a "future" that was to be cut off?

That was――,

Goz: [――Your Excellency! The soldiers have all returned with the faces of warriors! What do you wish to do?]

That moment, the instant Vincent’s thoughts flowed together, from a pile of rubble, Goz violently jumped down.

Looking around, one after another, gathering around them were the Imperial Soldiers who came with their equipped swords and armor clanging, a pack of Sword Wolves. In the face of this unprecedented situation, they must have been confused and uneasy. However, following the call of the Lion Knight Goz Ralfon, they gathered together, and when they realized that the Vollachian Emperor was waiting for them ahead, they tightened their expressions as they stood.

Vincent: [――――]

It was the terrible and loathsome way of being one of the people of the Empire.

But in order to fight the coming calamity, a Sword Wolf must not forget its hunger. Spending years for that reason, recalling the time that had passed, Vincent looked up at the sky.

To accumulate national strength, to maintain the discipline and morale of the soldiers, and to leave behind an Empire that would be able to withstand the calamity. ――The plan had gone awry, but there was no intention of leaving it as it was.

Vincent: [Moguro Hagane! Do not let the rebels use the Magic Crystal Cannon! As long as you protect it, I will grant your wish!]

Moguro: [――――]

There was no telling whether or not these words, in the midst of waging war against the currently strongest creature in the world, a Dragon, could be understood by Moguro. 

However, that admirable Meteor listened to human words attentively. They looked as if they did not have ears, but they were reliable.

Then, having sent out instructions to the assembled Generals, Vincent lowered his gaze and surveyed the faces of the soldiers who had gathered around him.

Then, looking at those Sword Wolves, whose will to fight was undiminished, he continued.

――Chisha Gold, if he was a perfect Vincent Vollachia,

Vincent: [We are withdrawing from the Imperial Capital! We are heading northwest to the Fortress City Garkla!]

A plan to take advantage of to oppose the Great Disaster, if it was prepared, it would be in that land, he loudly declared.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Both the Imperial Soldiers and the rebels that were a part of the battlefield had begun to realize that the struggle to set the direction for the Vollachian Empire had changed shape.

With the striking change in the degree of confusion that spread everywhere, the Sword Wolves, enthralled in the battle, sensed the intervention of boorish intentions.

Then, with orders flying around from the commanding officers who had a change in expression, the mindsets of the two sides who were obediently crossing spears were changed by their slightly regained composure and battle intuition.

Due to that, the two sides that were fiercely fighting each other until only a few moments before ceased their hostilities, replaced the title of Imperial Soldier or rebel with the title “citizen of the Empire,” and became a pack of wolves.

At that moment, Vincent Vollachia, at the center of the Imperial Capital, and Serena Dracroy, at the siege surrounding the city, had both just raised their voices as chief commanders.

Simply put, the changes that everyone from the Empire had sensed were circumstances that necessitated immediate action. Completely unrelated to these events, there was still a battlefield burning bright red that would be able to reduce everyone else to ashes.

――The Spirit Eater Arakiya, protecting the first bastion, was being confronted by Priscilla Barielle and Yorna Mishigure, magnificent and bewitching women of strong character.

Yorna: [――Love me.]

As the world was dominated by red radiant flames, Yorna gallantly kicked the ground with a fire lit in one of her eyes.

The hem of her kimono fluttered glamorously, and when Yorna's long legs, which made her tall for a woman, touched the ground, the earth rose up the next moment and aided her sprint in both speed and momentum.

This was not the Demon City Chaosflame, but only the land surrounding the Imperial City, the territory of the Emperor of Vollachia.

Long ago, beyond the memories of a past that had become distant for both Yorna Mishigure and Sandra Benedict, she had once desired for the Imperial Capital that seemed out of her reach.

A place she could never reach, as she held hands with a man who was so noble and of such a different status that she was afraid to whisper that she loved him, that Imperial Capital…

Yorna's Soul Marriage Technique could only be granted to her loved ones.

――Then, with this everlasting love for that man that would never fade, could Yorna not love the very land that he loved?

Yorna: [――It was also stolen from me.]

The Emperor of Vollachia, who was known as the King of Thorns at the time, and Iris, a girl who had fallen in love.

For the Emperor who was ousted from the throne, she sheltered him, supported him, and decided to walk the path together with him, and many people praised the King of Thorns and wished them well in their future together.

However, due to the molemen who had tricked them by manipulating them with sweet words, and the wolfmen who had betrayed them through ambition and arrogance, that future had lost its perfect ending.

The paradise that the King of Thorns was supposed to build, the construction of that promised world was abandoned. The Emperor, who was controlled by delusion, bonded the soul of the girl, who was supposed to disappear, with the blood of the traitors to the soil of the Empire.

Since then, Iris had been reborn again and again, changing her name and appearance.

She loved someone, she was loved by someone, and she continued to live.

But at the same time, this Vollachian Empire, the Empire’s very land, was the only thing that she could not love. Perhaps she hated it because it was so distant from the dream she had once envisioned.

But, however, such things were trivial compared to what was truly important.

Yorna: [――Love me.]

She did not decide if she could love; she just decided to love.

It was not an Empire with only happy memories. Happiness and unhappiness had been two sides of the same coin, both when she was Iris and throughout her many lifetimes after she was no longer Iris.

The same was true for Yorna's beloved children in the Demon City―― Sometimes, she would be choked up with love, and sometimes she would be angry at their pettiness.

Yorna: [――All of it, I am happy with.]

Yes, as the resounding “love” resonated within Yorna, the burning earth cheered.

The solid ground, which was only supposed to just catch her footsteps, gleefully lashed out, and the bouncing earth served as a foothold for Yorna, sending her high into the sky.

Spinning around, Yorna's thick-soled heels fell on Arakiya in mid-air.

Arakiya attempted to let it pass through her by assimilating with the air surrounding her. However, Yorna's kick burst through the brown skin that it should have slipped through.

Arakiya: [――ah?]

Her kicked shoulder exploded with pain, and Arakiya gave a small gasp at the impossible impact.

Arakiya's body, which had been assimilated with either fire, wind, or shadow, exploded from the impact, and her expression, which had rarely displayed such fiery emotion, was colored with pain and surprise.

For Arakiya, who continuously took full advantage of the traits of a Spirit Eater to gain the upper hand in every fight against her enemies, this was truly a bolt out of the blue.

But Yorna was neither surprised nor satisfied with the fact that her kick hit. Using her heel she struck with as a fulcrum, she raised her upper body and swung the kiseru held by her slender fingers, unleashing a follow-up attack.

Arakiya: [Eh, ah, wah.]

There was the sound of something hard continuously hitting her flesh, and Arakiya's expression was distorted in rapid succession.

Arakiya's voice escaped from her throat as if she could not comprehend the sensations she was suffering. It was an attitude of rejecting the idea of suffering rather than the suffering itself.

"Why", she asked Yorna. Arakiya's eyes were wide, even the one that could no longer see.

Yorna: [If there is love there, then there’s no meaning in boorish hesitation.]

Arakiya: [Love…?]

Yorna: [You're the foster sister of my ill-disciplined daughter, correct?]

Yorna's answer, with a beaming smile, filled Arakiya's face with a look of incomprehension.

Even though she had received an answer, her cheeks hardened when she did not understand the answer. Then, Arakiya freely flew in the sky at high speed to escape, causing waves of natural phenomena like a cataclysm.

Yorna, who was in midair, had no way to avoid her onslaught of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.

Yorna: [And, that would have been true before I made peace with the Empire.]

Spinning those words from her loosened lips, Yorna ran through the air on the footholds of earth that rose up one after another.

With her many resentful and happy emotional attachments, if she decided to love such a Vollachian Empire in its entirety, then the ground itself would respond and continue its ardent support.

Avoiding the rain of fire, the spears of water, the great waves of wind, and the slashes of light at every turn, Yorna once again closed in on Arakiya.

No longer did Arakiya have the advantage of being in the air. Since the ground reached wherever Yorna stepped, she reached the same height.

Arakiya: [――Ugh.]

She assimilated with the Spirits in the atmosphere and became transparent to enemy attacks.

Accustomed to dodging, Arakiya was slow to react to the approaching danger of Yorna and took a kick directly to her smooth-skinned torso.

The destructive force penetrated the back side of Arakiya's body, causing the great wind spirit she had assimilated with to shimmer through the world of red-tinted flames.

Arakiya: [――hk.]

Finally, pain was etched on Arakiya's face, overcoming her look of surprise.

This was definitely a sign that Yorna's attack was pushing Arakiya over the edge. Up until now, the flow of events going in Yorna’s favor was something to be proud of, but Yorna was not optimistic either.

That was because――,

Arakiya: [You… hk!]

With her cheeks contorted in pain and anger, Arakiya grabbed her tree branch and slammed it into Yorna.

It was simply picked up and used as an ordinary item, and yet it had never been broken, even in the midst of these natural disasters. Like a great treasured sword, it showed its true value in the hands of the Spirit Eater.

Yorna caught the swinging branch with her kiseru that she held in her upraised arm. The edge of her mouth quivered slightly as the two glared at each other in such close proximity.

Yorna: [Ku…]

The power of the blocked tree branch made Yorna's throat moan through her kiseru.

Yorna's Soul Marriage Technique could transfer pain and wounds to her own treasured belongings. Naturally, this was a secret technique that required an appropriate level of attachment and dedication.

However, Yorna's hairpins, earrings, and obidome, all of which had been donated to her by her beloved residents of the Demon City, were not consumed. In spite of this, Yorna herself was suffering pain.

The answer was simple and clear―― love is never a one-way street.

Yorna: [――Love me.]

If she decided to love the Empire, which was a mixture of love and hate, and if she decided to discipline Arakiya, with whom she had fallen into a hostile relationship, she needed to aim for compatibility rather than one-sidedly forcing love on her.

This was the exact opposite of how Yorna Mishigure's Soul Marriage Technique was originally intended to be used.

△▼△▼△▼△

Priscilla: [――――]

In midair, Yorna and Arakiya faced off in a fierce battle.

Priscilla, holding the dazzling Yang Sword in her hand, with flames in one eye proving that she was loved, frowned at the sight of her mother and foster sister clashing without restraint.

As a user of the same Soul Marriage Technique, she understood the reasoning behind Yorna's actions.

However, because they were both users of the Soul Marriage Technique, Priscilla could understand the forbidden nature of what Yorna was doing.

Priscilla: [Focusing only on the strength of the technique, you have no regard for its weaknesses. You too, Dear Mother, are reckless.]

It only took a glance to see how Yorna could ignore Arakiya's nature as a Spirit Eater and allow her attacks to flow through, but it required a precise handling of magic and a willingness to suffer the wounds herself.

Both Priscilla and Yorna were no strangers to the Soul Marriage Technique, a secret art that required a talent so rare that it had no historical inheritors, and required a miraculous sense of balance to put it into practice.

In short, Yorna's efforts were a risky gamble that would not only prevent Arakiya's attacks from reaching her, but could even sever her connection with the loved ones who had given her gifts.

Priscilla: [――――]

Priscilla was neither foolish nor heartless enough so as not to contemplate why Yorna would take such a risky gamble to face Arakiya and turn his head.

For the sake of Priscilla, Yorna embraced that taboo.

――In order to prevent Priscilla from getting into a situation where she would have to be in 
 conflict with Arakiya.

Priscilla: [With mine Yang Sword, I shan’t have to brave the same crisis as Dear Mother.]

The true essence of the Yang Sword's properties was that it cut what one wanted to cut, and burned what one wanted to burn.

When its true value was demonstrated, its white flame could deliver Priscilla's slashes without regard to Arakiya's characteristics, even if Arakiya had all natural phenomena as her ally.

While maintaining the effect of the Soul Marriage Technique, the attacker was able to reach their opponent.

This was exactly what happened when Priscilla and Arakiya met again for the first time in nearly a decade, and under these circumstances, Priscilla could obviously not entertain the notion of doing the same thing.
 
So, Yorna smacked Priscilla on the head, and fought on the forefront as such.

Priscilla: [To strike mine head like that…]

It was tempting to argue that she was a mother, but that was precisely the case.

Reflecting upon her feelings, Priscilla realized that before Yorna struck her on the head with her kiseru, she had been uncharacteristically enthusiastic.

Upon arriving at this point, she felt that she had to deal with Arakiya herself.

However――,

Priscilla: [――A Spirit Eater's karma, is it?]

It was inevitable that a manufactured species such as Arakiya’s would be endowed with particularly distorted characteristics.

To wield great power, one must pay the appropriate price. Not to mention Priscilla's Yang Sword or Soul Marriage Technique, the same was true of Arakiya's Spirit Eating powers.

Of course, Priscilla was aware of what kind of being Arakiya was born to be when she accompanied her. She even did her own research. However, she was not careful enough.

The result gave Arakiya, who could not stand without support, a pillar called Priscilla.

Priscilla: [If mine radiant sun were hidden, the world shall be cloaked in darkness.]

For ten years, Arakiya lived in a world cloaked in darkness.

Perhaps it was impossible for someone to fill Priscilla's role, but would not someone have cast a ray of light upon the shadow?

When she dissolved her house and decided not to take Arakiya, she thought it would be Vincent.

Priscilla: [That would be impossible.]

Furrowing her brow at her own thoughts, Priscilla dismissed the idea.

At the time, Priscilla was still young and bright ――when she was Prisca, she was mistaken. She thought she could trust her older brother with such a task, but she was mistaken.

As the battle for the Imperial Capital took such a radical turn, and as she learned of the strength of the other Nine Divine Generals besides Arakiya gathered by her older brother, Vincent Vollachia, she noticed. She understood.

Vincent intended to fight a very different and greater thing than a rebellion.

Moreover, he had no intention of surviving at the end of the battle. When the battle was over, to whom did he intend to entrust the throne he had lost?

Arakiya's loyalty could not change for someone else.

Priscilla: [Nonsense.]

Everything was built up on the board on the desk, and the world was constructed accordingly, as a matter of fact.

That was Vincent's strength, but no matter how good his wits were, if his envisioned form of perfection was mistaken, the world as he envisioned would be undeniably distorted.

He shall one day be rewarded for his lack of awareness. Or maybe he will receive it in this battle, however――.

Priscilla: [We have been apart for ten years. Enough, Elder Brother, you shall distance yourself from your little sister.]

Priscilla strode forward, casting dishonor on her counterpart, who was absent from the scene.

The sky was dyed red with flames, and the earth was raging at the behest of The Flamboyant. It was as if heaven and earth were all refusing the intervention of the sun, Priscilla.

However, to such a presumptuous world, Priscilla Barielle ――or rather, the daughter formerly known as Prisca Benedict, had only one thing to say.

Priscilla: [――Everything in this world is made for my convenience.]

△▼△▼△▼△

It would then be wrong to describe what Arakiya felt as humiliation or disgrace.

Humiliation must come with a name that can be humiliated with regret.

Disgrace is not without the pride of being humiliated by falling behind.

Arakiya had no attachment to her name or any kind of pride.

Among the Nine Divine Generals, the most honorable position for a General of the Empire, she was the Second, the highest rank except for Cecilus, who was said to be a mistake. She was the Spirit Eater, an extremely powerful person with unparalleled characteristics that could not be found anywhere else in the world, let alone in the Empire.

Despite being blessed with the status and abilities that many people desperately desired, those things could not become the "pillar" that supported Arakiya as an individual.

Arakiya defined herself as a beast in the wild.

Beasts that live by hunting other creatures have no pride in their fangs and claws. ――No, Arakiya only thought so, but beasts do have their own pride and ways of doing things.

That being the case, Arakiya's self-perception was far from even that of a beast.

Fire, wind, water, earth, light, shadow, untouchable phenomena.

There was no will that intervened, only the realization of what was desired.

Arakiya wanted to be a phenomenon, neither man nor beast.

She wanted to be a phenomenon that did not feel humiliated or disgraced.

If so――,

Arakiya: [I am――]

Arakiya turned into the wind to deal with the barrage of fierce attacks. However, she was unable to handle it completely. The wind was seized, and the blows left a pain and heaviness inside Arakiya.

A cry of anguish escaped, and Arakiya's face contorted in distress. As a Spirit Eater, she did not often experience pain in battle, but she was by no means immune to it.

Arakiya had already experienced all kinds of pain as a child.

In order to obtain the qualities of a Spirit Eater, the adults around Arakiya tried every conceivable method, carving, and iterating.

Not afraid of pain. She would not cower in remembering the past.

However, the mere fact of being realized was greater than the pain for Arakiya.

Fire will not suffer pain, nor will it die if it is extinguished by water.

Was Arakiya nothing more than fire that would suffer pain and die when extinguished by water?

Arakiya was afraid of denying to herself that she could not be a phenomenon.

Arakiya: [I――]

Yorna: [――Silence, you.]

Driven by frustration, she tried to speak out, but her opponent's slap landed across her face.

The power of the attack erased the flames from Arakiya's neck up, which quickly recovered their original form, but the pain remained, as did the damage to Arakiya's psyche.

It was neither humiliation nor disgrace, but a seeming denial of her existence. Arakiya raised the ground as if being pursued and turned her palm toward Yorna, who leapt on her.

She did not know what was happening, but both Prisca and Yorna somehow managed to escape Arakiya's attacks at some point. As soon as Yorna had sealed her technique, their attacks began to reach Arakiya. At the same time, Arakiya's attacks also began to reach Yorna.

Arakiya: [――Hk.]

Just one time, one shot, one hit.

Yorna herself had raised the level of her physical abilities, either through an unknown technique or magic. However, if she did not use that technique to escape damage, that meant Arakiya's attacks would get through.

As long as she was able to hit――,

Arakiya: [The Princess and…!]

If she could get rid of that annoying Yorna, she would be left alone with just Prisca and herself.

So long as that happened, surely everything would turn out well.

???: [If there's something you want, it's more constructive to go out and get it than to wait, right?]

Yes, Todd had said that, too.

Todd's words strangely resonated strongly in Arakiya's mind.

It was neither because of convenience nor because of human favoritism, she thought.

Todd's words were devoid of any emotion toward Arakiya. That was comforting. Just as one does not love fire or water, Todd had no feelings toward Arakiya.

Being treated so vacuously was Arakiya's salvation.

That was why――,

Arakiya: [――――]

The tree branch in her hand burst into flames from tip to tail, turning into black dust.

The branch was just something she had picked up; it had no special power. It was merely a clear indicator that defined where Arakiya intended to direct her power.

The fact that she had burned that wooden stick was a sign that she was unleashing a firepower that did not need to be aimed.

The Spirit Eater, Arakiya, was regarded as one of the Empire's strongest, and her greatest power was only ever unleashed once during a skirmish with Cecilus Segmunt.

Because the opponent was Cecilus, no damage was done, but Arakiya's outburst left the northern part of the Imperial Capital a burnt wasteland. The Emperor, Vincent, told Arakiya that it would not be tolerated a second time. Later, at Chisha's suggestion, the burnt land was reused as a reservoir, but the blow was powerful enough to redraw the map.

Priscilla: [――Everything in this world is made for my convenience.]

――The slash issued by a dignified and confident voice drowned everything out.

A flash of the Yang Sword swallowed the flames that would have scorched the world black.

Prisca leapt to Yorna's side, her long, beautiful hair fluttering in the hot wind as Arakiya was reflected in her eyes, one lit by flames and the other not.

And then――,

Priscilla: [Dear Mother.]

The moment her lips moved, Yorna, moving from behind Prisca, unleashed a ferocious kick.

Prisca, who placed her foot on the sole of that released attack, converted the momentum of the kick into her own forward motion, launching herself and approaching Arakiya with a speed that could be mistaken for light.

Prisca then raised the Yang Sword in her hand,

Priscilla: [Arakiya.]

With a flash, and a single word, Arakiya's movements were all sealed off.

The reflexive defensive action of Arakiya, an evasion that blended her with the atmosphere, was twisted and crushed by Prisca's flash, mercilessly piercing her entire body.

Arakiya: [――――]

Arakiya's consciousness was cut off.

Ironically, it was cut off exactly the same way it had been when the northern part of the Imperial Capital was burned to the ground, just the same way as when she had been hit by a flash from Cecilus just after she had unleashed her maximum firepower.

But, finally, in the end, she heard it.

Priscilla: [Mine Yang Sword cuts what I want to cut, burns what I want to burn. ――And strikes what I want to strike.]

As she said this, the now fallen Arakiya did not realize that Prisca had swung the Yang Sword―― not by its blade, but by its hilt.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The boy smiled. No matter the time, he was always smiling.

Even if the color of the sky changed, even if these vast lands violently fissured, even if a natural disaster yet unseen by those blue eyes assailed upon the world, and unprecedented events tried to get in his way, he would smile.

Had he gone crazy? Yeah, he was crazy.

Had he been drunk? Yeah, he was drunk.

Not on battle. Not on alcohol. Not on love. Not on blood. 

Absolutely, thoroughly, unquestionably, a maniac. Definitely, undoubtedly, unequivocally, a drunkard. That boy continued to smile.

If he did not do so――,

Boy: [――Folk who are busy wouldn’t perch their eyes on the stage of a boring actor, now would they?]

Even when nothing happens, tears could be spilled. But, was it possible that, even when nothing happens, one could smile?

If so, then smiling would be the beginning of something. Smiling, would signify that a tale was beginning to unfold.

Whether that tale had already begun, or was just beginning from here, he did not know.

That was to say, smiling was proof of one settling their resolve to rise to the stage; such was how the boy defined it.

Therefore――,

Boy: [By all means, feel free to smile, how about it? You’ve gone through great trouble to get everything fully prepared up ‘till here. If possible, giving you a big laugh would feel just as good as defeating you!]
